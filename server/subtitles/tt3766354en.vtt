2
00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:08.370
Hot water, please.

3
00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.028
Excuse me?

4
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.606
He said car is closed.

5
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.235
He'll get for you.

6
00:02:34.332 --> 00:02:36.239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

7
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.047
American?

8
00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:40.552
Guilty.

9
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.810
- First time to Turkey?
- No, no, no.

10
00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:57.921
Been here...

11
00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:00.209
long time ago.

12
00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:03.021
- Different life.
- Mmm.

13
00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:06.419
- Now you come back.
- Yes.

14
00:03:07.122 --> 00:03:08.992
Looking for something.

15
00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:20.414
My brother say,

16
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.916
you can find whatever
you wish in Turkey.

17
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:25.692
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

18
00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:29.257
How 'bout a man who
kidnapped his own daughter

19
00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:32.581
and took her away
from her American mother?

20
00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.089
An abusive man,
so not a real man.

21
00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.512
No love for the child,
just a...

22
00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:42.025
need to punish his ex-wife.

23
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.729
To take the one
thing away from her

24
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.071
that meant everything to her

25
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.919
with no intention of
returning the child.

26
00:03:50.408 --> 00:03:53.791
Do you think that...
Excuse me.

27
00:03:56.287 --> 00:04:00.350
Do you think I could find that
man in Turkey? Or maybe...

28
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:02.216
on his way to Turkey?

29
00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:05.246
I uh...

30
00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:08.847
would not be looking
for such a man.

31
00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.152
It will be...

32
00:04:13.927 --> 00:04:15.526
dangerous.

33
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:18.963
For you.

34
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:23.140
Men like him would think that.

35
00:04:23.354 --> 00:04:25.022
And God as my witness,

36
00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:27.152
I would give him a chance.

37
00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:28.736
To stop.

38
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.677
To reconsider.

39
00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:36.316
To think about the worst thing
that could ever happen to him.

40
00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:38.581
To imagine that.

41
00:05:42.857 --> 00:05:45.534
There are two kinds
of pain in this world.

42
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:53.736
Pain that hurts.

43
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.670
Pain that alters.

44
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:46.991
Baby!

45
00:06:48.432 --> 00:06:50.428
Oh, baby!

46
00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:55.219
Mom!

47
00:06:55.244 --> 00:06:56.842
Oh, my baby!

48
00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:01.877
Are you okay?

49
00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:07.253
My baby!

50
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.259
The State Department doesn't
know a thing about it, Grace.

51
00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:11.734
No one does.

52
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.147
Just that 45 minutes ago,

53
00:07:13.172 --> 00:07:16.801
someone delivered your daughter
to the desk downstairs.

54
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.067
Oh, I love you so much!
I love you, I love you!

55
00:08:48.346 --> 00:08:51.783
My favorite driver,
always on time like a trucker!

56
00:08:54.527 --> 00:08:55.841
Samuel!

57
00:08:55.898 --> 00:08:59.762
Ah, Roberto, it's not easy
gettin' in and out here.

58
00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:01.389
- Copy Center?
- Eh?

59
00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:03.733
- Copy Center?
- Yes!

60
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.935
Lift off!

61
00:09:21.502 --> 00:09:23.158
How am I today?

62
00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.774
The same, only worse.

63
00:09:28.428 --> 00:09:30.984
Every day, I know less.

64
00:09:31.397 --> 00:09:33.122
Welcome to the club.

65
00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:52.071
Thanks for the lift.

66
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:07.105
I have a piece of advice:

67
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.048
Always be nice to anybody who
has access to your toothbrush.

68
00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.258
Hm.

69
00:10:17.004 --> 00:10:18.125
Okay.

70
00:10:18.168 --> 00:10:19.986
Thank you for this
interview and opportunity.

71
00:10:20.476 --> 00:10:22.543
Now, as you can see
from my resume...

72
00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:24.468
No, no, no.

73
00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:28.324
Thank you for this opportunity.

74
00:10:29.283 --> 00:10:31.456
I've admired your company's
position towards the environment

75
00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:33.694
for quite some time, and
to be a part of that...

76
00:10:33.818 --> 00:10:36.474
Ma! Ma, I got accepted!

77
00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.691
Yeah, I got accepted by...
I got...

78
00:10:39.716 --> 00:10:42.876
"It is of great pleasure
that we write to offer you

79
00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:44.824
"admission to the
College of Engineering

80
00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:47.050
"Class of 2019." Ma!

81
00:10:49.967 --> 00:10:52.153
I don't get to choose
when I go, Tommy.

82
00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:54.268
The Army does that.

83
00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:57.224
I'll text you when I'm at the gate.
I love you both.

84
00:10:57.276 --> 00:10:59.562
- Where you headed?
- Iraq.

85
00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:04.053
- First tour?
- Yes, sir.

86
00:11:04.683 --> 00:11:07.069
I'll be there to pick you up
when you get back.

87
00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:09.653
Thank you.

88
00:11:27.157 --> 00:11:29.966
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.
- Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

89
00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:31.699
How they comin'?

90
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:33.198
Left you something upstairs.

91
00:11:33.223 --> 00:11:34.746
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:11:35.488 --> 00:11:36.876
Thank you, Fatima.

93
00:11:36.975 --> 00:11:38.949
- You coming to the potluck?
- Yes, I'm coming.

94
00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:41.784
Plates and napkins,
napkins and plates.

95
00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:45.051
And forks!

96
00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:58.314
I got your name on a piece
of paper in my pocket.

97
00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:00.770
That's all that matters.

98
00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:04.152
Hey, hey, hey!
Look at me.

99
00:14:08.691 --> 00:14:10.629
No, no, no, stop talking.

100
00:14:10.813 --> 00:14:13.087
- This is happening.
- Please don't.

101
00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:14.934
Your son's gonna be
home any second.

102
00:14:15.282 --> 00:14:16.433
Right?

103
00:14:17.101 --> 00:14:19.003
- Open your mouth.
- No.

104
00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:21.051
Open your mouth.

105
00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:41.919
And you don't have
to know anything.

106
00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:47.651
They are the best.

107
00:15:07.344 --> 00:15:08.509
Hey.

108
00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:10.994
Mr. McCall.

109
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.736
Ordered a book last week.

110
00:15:13.793 --> 00:15:15.093
Oh, uh, yeah.

111
00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:22.859
McCall...

112
00:15:23.482 --> 00:15:26.175
I... I don't see it, um...

113
00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.944
I'll be right back.

114
00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:38.257
The man with the list. 100
books everyone should read.

115
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.358
- Guilty as charged.
- <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>.

116
00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:42.799
Came in yesterday.

117
00:15:42.824 --> 00:15:44.213
Thank you.

118
00:15:44.447 --> 00:15:46.237
What number?

119
00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:48.681
Last one.

120
00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:51.791
Well, I hope you
start another list.

121
00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:53.437
Me too. How much?

122
00:15:53.498 --> 00:15:55.048
Uh, 40, please.

123
00:15:55.356 --> 00:15:56.791
Thank you.

124
00:16:01.117 --> 00:16:02.745
Sign is down?

125
00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:05.499
"For sale" sign?

126
00:16:05.524 --> 00:16:07.822
Oh, a change of circumstances.

127
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.996
Not going anywhere now.

128
00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:30.392
I don't want a drink.

129
00:16:31.886 --> 00:16:33.559
I don't want a drink.

130
00:16:37.077 --> 00:16:38.455
God...

131
00:16:39.726 --> 00:16:42.894
Grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change...

132
00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:45.621
The courage to change
the things I can...

133
00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:49.776
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

134
00:16:55.025 --> 00:16:56.410
Would you um...

135
00:16:56.538 --> 00:16:59.301
Would you mind taking me
back where you picked me up?

136
00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:30.002
Easy... easy.

137
00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:32.573
One step, keep going.

138
00:17:44.723 --> 00:17:47.656
Could you just...
help her get in her apartment?

139
00:17:47.856 --> 00:17:48.949
Thanks.

140
00:18:26.864 --> 00:18:28.691
Stop cheatin', bro.

141
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:38.362
How you doin'? I'm the uh,
Lyft driver that you called

142
00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:39.797
to take home your girlfriend.

143
00:18:39.822 --> 00:18:41.835
Not a girlfriend, man.
Just an intern.

144
00:18:41.864 --> 00:18:45.562
Oh, I'm sorry, the uh,
credit card was invalid.

145
00:18:46.877 --> 00:18:48.447
Shithead!

146
00:18:48.532 --> 00:18:50.357
Let you hang with us 'cause
your daddy's a client

147
00:18:50.414 --> 00:18:52.105
and you fuck up the first thing.

148
00:18:52.773 --> 00:18:53.986
Come in.

149
00:19:01.949 --> 00:19:04.516
- There you go.
- Wow.

150
00:19:05.418 --> 00:19:07.918
I heard about these.
I've never seen one before.

151
00:19:07.967 --> 00:19:09.333
Yeah, well, now you have.

152
00:19:09.369 --> 00:19:10.385
Yeah.

153
00:19:10.462 --> 00:19:12.672
Look, pay yourself
whatever and uh,

154
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.533
give yourself a nice tip, huh?

155
00:19:14.593 --> 00:19:16.457
Thank you. Thank you.

156
00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:19.618
You're not gonna ask me
if she got home okay?

157
00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:23.828
- She get home okay?
- No.

158
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.452
Took her Mass General, they're
pumping her stomach as we speak.

159
00:19:29.274 --> 00:19:31.060
What's her name?

160
00:19:31.898 --> 00:19:33.460
You don't know, do you?

161
00:19:34.001 --> 00:19:35.286
Okay.

162
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.893
This is the point where
usually I'd uh...

163
00:19:37.918 --> 00:19:40.226
give you a chance to do the
right thing, but not tonight.

164
00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:43.443
Tonight, I'm gonna need
your cameras, cellphones,

165
00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.671
anything you might've used to
record what you did to her.

166
00:20:17.824 --> 00:20:20.251
You knocked on the wrong
door tonight, pops.

167
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.785
Get up.

168
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.398
Get up!

169
00:20:55.198 --> 00:20:57.548
Don't start crying now.
Give me your phone.

170
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.476
Right or left?

171
00:21:01.501 --> 00:21:02.754
I don't know what you mean.

172
00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:04.991
Handed.
Are you right or left-handed?

173
00:21:05.117 --> 00:21:06.951
- Right.
- Call 911.

174
00:21:06.993 --> 00:21:09.428
And tell them the truth about
what happened in here tonight.

175
00:21:09.478 --> 00:21:12.339
Your daddy's money's not gonna save
you this time, you understand?

176
00:21:12.364 --> 00:21:14.096
- Yes, sir.
- You know her name?

177
00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:16.439
No.

178
00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:19.394
Her name is Amy,
give me your left hand.

179
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.944
Give me your left hand.

180
00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:32.646
I expect a five-star rating,
you understand?

181
00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:35.793
- Yes, sir.
- Not for me, though. For who?

182
00:21:36.555 --> 00:21:38.489
- For Amy.
- That's right. For who?

183
00:21:38.524 --> 00:21:40.022
- For Amy.
- For who?

184
00:21:48.087 --> 00:21:50.388
Make sure I get a
five-star rating, junior.

185
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.823
Hello, Susan.

186
00:23:10.835 --> 00:23:13.000
How in God's name do
you know it was me?

187
00:23:13.057 --> 00:23:14.663
I can smell you.

188
00:23:14.704 --> 00:23:16.530
For God's sake, I just peed.

189
00:23:17.127 --> 00:23:20.472
Yeah, but you ate
asparagus vinaigrette.

190
00:23:20.585 --> 00:23:22.972
- With soy sauce.
- Oh, you!

191
00:23:23.057 --> 00:23:25.330
Oh, I smelled your perfume.
How are ya?

192
00:23:26.225 --> 00:23:27.993
- You good?
- Better now.

193
00:23:28.035 --> 00:23:29.413
Ah, very good.

194
00:23:29.854 --> 00:23:31.615
- Got you some.
- Ah, soup!

195
00:23:31.686 --> 00:23:33.341
How'd that thing in
Turkey turn out?

196
00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:34.975
Ah, happy ending.

197
00:23:35.024 --> 00:23:36.637
- Mmm!
- No pun intended.

198
00:23:36.662 --> 00:23:38.789
Well, I guess that means
you owe me dinner.

199
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.516
I didn't agree to pay
for dinner, I...

200
00:23:41.715 --> 00:23:43.043
What, you gonna try
and weasel out?

201
00:23:43.086 --> 00:23:44.425
I'm not weaseling, I just...

202
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.743
Oh, no, no, no, my friend.
I don't work for free.

203
00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:51.125
How's Brian?

204
00:23:53.576 --> 00:23:55.515
He's good. Oh, he's
got a new book out.

205
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.035
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.172
- Maybe I should read it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

207
00:23:59.233 --> 00:24:01.776
You know, if geopolitics
of Nepal prior to the

208
00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:05.948
1816 Sugauli Treaty is
your bag, definitely.

209
00:24:06.157 --> 00:24:09.293
- Friendship has its limits.
- So does matrimony.

210
00:24:09.343 --> 00:24:11.168
I haven't read it yet.

211
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.874
Doubt I ever will.

212
00:24:14.633 --> 00:24:16.204
You here on business?

213
00:24:16.446 --> 00:24:17.873
Meetings.

214
00:24:18.427 --> 00:24:20.011
Ahem.

215
00:24:20.486 --> 00:24:22.264
Meetings, huh?

216
00:24:22.488 --> 00:24:24.167
Birthdays are the hardest.

217
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.984
I know, I always think
of my brother on his.

218
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.227
Yeah.

219
00:24:32.464 --> 00:24:35.374
I was uh, folding laundry
the other day, and...

220
00:24:36.205 --> 00:24:39.437
I realized that I didn't have

221
00:24:39.615 --> 00:24:43.734
any clothes left that
Vivian had ever seen.

222
00:24:44.134 --> 00:24:46.184
I can't say that's a bad thing.

223
00:24:46.597 --> 00:24:47.791
What?

224
00:24:49.338 --> 00:24:52.257
Well, she didn't appreciate my
taste in clothing either.

225
00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:55.063
I'd buy something,
the next day it was missing.

226
00:24:55.156 --> 00:24:56.585
I'd ask her about it.

227
00:24:56.681 --> 00:25:00.352
And she... say she didn't know
what I was talking about.

228
00:25:00.387 --> 00:25:01.973
Or she'd act like she didn't
know what I was talking about.

229
00:25:01.998 --> 00:25:03.230
I could tell. And she's,

230
00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:05.174
"I don't know what
happened to those

231
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:08.164
"purple shirts that
you used to buy."

232
00:25:08.294 --> 00:25:12.094
Then I'd...
put one on that she liked.

233
00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:19.445
What?

234
00:25:20.205 --> 00:25:21.718
I didn't say anything.

235
00:25:23.976 --> 00:25:28.486
I'm sorry if I made a mistake
coming to you on Vivian's birthday.

236
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.207
It's just...
Robert, I've been thinkin'...

237
00:25:31.423 --> 00:25:33.883
Maybe you should
go back, huh?

238
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.897
It's great you helping all these

239
00:25:38.933 --> 00:25:41.696
random people and
everything, but...

240
00:25:42.797 --> 00:25:45.502
It's not gonna fill
that hole in your heart.

241
00:25:47.994 --> 00:25:49.572
Go home, huh?

242
00:25:50.672 --> 00:25:52.179
Make peace with it.

243
00:25:55.711 --> 00:25:57.939
That's what
Vivian would've wanted.

244
00:25:59.573 --> 00:26:00.885
Oh, hey!

245
00:26:09.788 --> 00:26:12.007
- Always a gentleman.
- That's right.

246
00:26:12.048 --> 00:26:14.636
Hey, I'm obligated
to tell you these things.

247
00:26:14.998 --> 00:26:16.898
Man, I'm the only
friend you've got.

248
00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:18.017
Mmm.

249
00:26:21.535 --> 00:26:22.983
Airport, please.

250
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.462
Hey, Mr. McCall, maybe
you could find out

251
00:26:51.487 --> 00:26:53.635
who did this
to Fatima's garden.

252
00:26:58.686 --> 00:26:59.927
Kids.

253
00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:23.634
- What up, man?
- How you doing?

254
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.978
Hey, you should make
the building do that.

255
00:27:32.523 --> 00:27:34.410
It's what they're
supposed to do.

256
00:27:34.648 --> 00:27:39.675
'Supposed to do' and 'will do'
are two different things, Miles.

257
00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:42.426
- Yeah, but you live here, right?
- That's right.

258
00:27:42.497 --> 00:27:44.032
Pay the rent, too.

259
00:27:44.358 --> 00:27:46.183
You should let somebody
else do this, then.

260
00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:47.466
Like who?

261
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:49.221
Shit, I don't know.

262
00:27:49.482 --> 00:27:51.123
- Anybody.
- Huh?

263
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.419
Not a tenant.

264
00:27:52.444 --> 00:27:53.943
You're right. I guess
anybody could do it,

265
00:27:53.986 --> 00:27:55.925
but nobody does, Miles.

266
00:27:56.067 --> 00:27:57.750
It ends up everybody

267
00:27:57.843 --> 00:27:59.874
complaining because
nobody did what

268
00:27:59.966 --> 00:28:01.944
anybody coulda done.

269
00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:04.675
Or shoulda done
to begin with.

270
00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:06.365
Yeah.

271
00:28:07.512 --> 00:28:08.766
Aight.

272
00:28:10.701 --> 00:28:12.050
You know they got uh,

273
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.699
they got painting
companies around here.

274
00:28:13.731 --> 00:28:16.973
I know they charge $6-700
to do the job. I know that.

275
00:28:16.998 --> 00:28:19.201
Ssh... Oh, yeah?

276
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.957
Shit, I'll do this for $350.

277
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.358
You?

278
00:28:25.429 --> 00:28:26.793
Ssh, yeah!

279
00:28:27.446 --> 00:28:29.173
- What?
- Nothin'.

280
00:28:29.224 --> 00:28:31.297
What, I look handicapped
or somethin'?

281
00:28:31.763 --> 00:28:34.495
Yo, it's a quick dip and roll,
it ain't rocket science.

282
00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:35.781
No, you're right.

283
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.897
I'm an artist, man.

284
00:28:39.354 --> 00:28:41.727
I go to Bridgeview Arts.

285
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.944
Why aren't you in school?

286
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:48.283
I don't be doin' all them
everyday classes.

287
00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:51.706
You know I got a

288
00:28:51.777 --> 00:28:54.021
- a special talent.
- Yes, you do.

289
00:28:54.777 --> 00:28:56.770
And it takes talent
to make money.

290
00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:01.166
But it takes brains
to keep it, Miles.

291
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.328
Yeah, well, I'm out here
makin' my money, man.

292
00:29:05.449 --> 00:29:07.335
Short money, Miles.

293
00:29:07.506 --> 00:29:09.236
That's short money.

294
00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:13.060
I tell you what...

295
00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:16.760
$350's a little high.

296
00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:20.425
But I appreciate the offer.

297
00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:23.670
Aight.

298
00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.478
- All right?
- Aight.

299
00:29:27.686 --> 00:29:29.717
This gonna be
a lotta work, man.

300
00:29:30.997 --> 00:29:33.418
- Aight, Mr. McCall.
- All right.

301
00:29:55.044 --> 00:29:56.827
So, you still
out here doin' this?

302
00:29:56.897 --> 00:29:58.339
Yes, I am.

303
00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.058
You ain't coverin' nothin'.

304
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:01.677
Not yet.

305
00:30:02.494 --> 00:30:04.110
What is this,
Wal-Mart paint?

306
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:07.348
Primer. You gotta
prime it before you paint it.

307
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:08.870
They don't teach you
that in art school?

308
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.014
Yeah, I knew that.

309
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:16.135
I've been thinkin'
'bout your offer.

310
00:30:17.498 --> 00:30:20.473
I've been uh, calibratin' uh...

311
00:30:21.526 --> 00:30:22.975
250.

312
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.661
- 250?
- Yeah.

313
00:30:26.769 --> 00:30:28.770
250, I take care
all o' this for you.

314
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.442
- For 250?
- Yeah.

315
00:30:33.727 --> 00:30:35.445
All right but,

316
00:30:35.653 --> 00:30:37.599
you can only work on it
after school.

317
00:30:37.689 --> 00:30:39.715
- Ssh...
- Don't curse.

318
00:30:39.792 --> 00:30:41.680
What time you get out?

319
00:30:42.697 --> 00:30:45.643
- 3:15.
- Okay. After school, 3:15, deal?

320
00:30:46.325 --> 00:30:47.532
Okay?

321
00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:49.200
Aight.

322
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.124
- Cash, aight?
- Okay, cash.

323
00:30:53.214 --> 00:30:55.536
- Don't checkin' me, aight?
- I'll be checkin' <i>for</i> you.

324
00:30:55.614 --> 00:30:56.993
Tss... aight.

325
00:30:59.812 --> 00:31:01.183
Miles!

326
00:31:01.636 --> 00:31:03.605
Stay off them corners, son.

327
00:31:06.253 --> 00:31:07.997
Oil on his lips.

328
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.728
Nine millimeter at his feet
was registered to the victim.

329
00:31:12.906 --> 00:31:15.086
No other prints in the house.

330
00:31:15.381 --> 00:31:16.703
You have questions?

331
00:31:16.798 --> 00:31:18.826
Oh, Mr. Calbert did work for us.

332
00:31:18.884 --> 00:31:21.227
And when something
occurs to one of ours,

333
00:31:21.277 --> 00:31:23.173
the agency's obligated
to look into it,

334
00:31:23.213 --> 00:31:25.288
So, yes, you will be hearing
from us, thank you.

335
00:31:25.325 --> 00:31:26.461
Susan, Susan...

336
00:31:26.504 --> 00:31:28.876
Keep it locked down
until we get there, please.

337
00:31:28.942 --> 00:31:30.190
I can't find
a file on this guy.

338
00:31:30.226 --> 00:31:31.491
When did he become
one of ours?

339
00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:32.666
I don't know.

340
00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:35.482
Upstairs kept him off the
radar for some reason.

341
00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:37.768
- Car's here. Car's here.
- Oh, okay.

342
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:39.117
- Oh, you look great.
- It's okay?

343
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.465
- What about a tie?
- Um...

344
00:31:40.529 --> 00:31:41.814
- You need a tie, darlin'.
- I...

345
00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:43.157
- Do what she says, Brian.
- Have one?

346
00:31:43.251 --> 00:31:45.267
- Got it.
- Great, that's perfect!

347
00:31:45.302 --> 00:31:46.353
I'll see you, dear.

348
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:48.094
- Have fun, sweetheart.
- Bye.

349
00:31:48.463 --> 00:31:50.820
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go
over there and cross the t's.

350
00:31:50.864 --> 00:31:52.071
Wanna come?

351
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:53.996
Oh, damn, and leave
this shitty office?

352
00:31:54.444 --> 00:31:56.254
You know Brussels
has the best chocolates.

353
00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:59.159
Hmm, well, we'll go
and find out.

354
00:31:59.504 --> 00:32:02.012
Today, I broke a personal best:

355
00:32:02.069 --> 00:32:04.825
Successive days alive.

356
00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:09.910
All right. Here,
I got photographic evidence.

357
00:32:09.984 --> 00:32:13.646
That's the portrait
of my sister, Magda.

358
00:32:13.947 --> 00:32:15.513
I was nine.

359
00:32:15.938 --> 00:32:17.573
The war came.

360
00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:20.386
Like most families,
we were separated.

361
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.569
My sister Magda and I
were sent to different camps.

362
00:32:25.197 --> 00:32:27.175
I never saw her again.

363
00:32:27.794 --> 00:32:31.925
60 years later, I'm in Paris.

364
00:32:32.133 --> 00:32:35.998
And I see somebody
auctioning my painting.

365
00:32:37.037 --> 00:32:39.527
12 million, can you imagine?

366
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.756
"You've got to have proof,"
they say, to get it back.

367
00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:47.487
Now, I got here
the proof.

368
00:32:48.026 --> 00:32:51.024
Wait till the judge sees this.

369
00:32:51.707 --> 00:32:54.082
Looks like there's
coming a storm.

370
00:32:55.091 --> 00:32:57.972
- It's time for your check-up, Sam.
- Oh.

371
00:32:58.416 --> 00:33:00.313
Hello, sweetheart.

372
00:33:05.739 --> 00:33:07.756
He's still obsessed
with the painting.

373
00:33:07.913 --> 00:33:09.660
Tried to help him years ago.

374
00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:13.220
He said he uh, had proof it
was his even way back then.

375
00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.681
He didn't.

376
00:33:15.038 --> 00:33:17.133
No record, no bill of sales.

377
00:33:17.797 --> 00:33:21.072
He just keeps going back to
court to hear the same thing.

378
00:33:22.022 --> 00:33:25.198
Guess it gives him something
to focus on, I suppose.

379
00:33:25.284 --> 00:33:27.776
It helps when
you have nobody left.

380
00:33:36.813 --> 00:33:38.178
I thought the reading
went great.

381
00:33:38.256 --> 00:33:39.528
- Embarrassing!
- No.

382
00:33:39.599 --> 00:33:41.871
I signed two books,
that's all.

383
00:33:44.034 --> 00:33:45.053
Thank you!

384
00:33:45.078 --> 00:33:46.822
You sure we can't
drop you off at the airport?

385
00:33:46.847 --> 00:33:48.547
No, I'm fine, Brian.
Thank you.

386
00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:49.961
- Thanks so much for coming.
- All right.

387
00:33:50.037 --> 00:33:51.322
- Good night.
- Good night.

388
00:33:51.356 --> 00:33:52.658
- Listen, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

389
00:33:52.715 --> 00:33:55.258
See what you can
find out. Yeah?

390
00:33:55.298 --> 00:33:57.005
Oh, another dinner, then.

391
00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.755
I'll see what I can do.

392
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.620
I do fly off
to Brussels tomorrow.

393
00:34:00.673 --> 00:34:02.576
- Thought you were retired?
- Oh, I am.

394
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:04.253
Just like you're dead.

395
00:34:04.301 --> 00:34:05.317
Okay.

396
00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:06.881
- Good night.
- Good, good night.

397
00:34:13.153 --> 00:34:14.907
What are you painting?

398
00:34:16.604 --> 00:34:17.847
It's primer.

399
00:34:18.676 --> 00:34:20.082
And then paint it.

400
00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:24.317
So all this bullshit under there,
don't show through.

401
00:34:25.305 --> 00:34:27.129
My brother painted that.

402
00:34:29.344 --> 00:34:31.107
It's the place we grew up.

403
00:34:31.227 --> 00:34:32.414
Yeah?

404
00:34:32.627 --> 00:34:34.182
And you live here now.

405
00:35:07.243 --> 00:35:09.518
Powder of some sort.

406
00:35:18.796 --> 00:35:21.563
Hard drive contents
and cell records?

407
00:35:22.082 --> 00:35:24.777
You'll have them later today.

408
00:35:32.165 --> 00:35:33.535
Susan...

409
00:35:35.754 --> 00:35:37.698
Okay. Thank you.

410
00:35:37.898 --> 00:35:39.766
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

411
00:35:43.386 --> 00:35:44.607
Merci.

412
00:35:46.364 --> 00:35:47.725
Right behind you.

413
00:36:02.508 --> 00:36:05.891
I don't know. It seems
to me, the judge...

414
00:36:06.224 --> 00:36:09.570
He doesn't even
pay any attention to me.

415
00:36:11.379 --> 00:36:15.458
I mean, he hardly looked
at all the evidence I had.

416
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:18.182
Well, that's it.

417
00:36:18.275 --> 00:36:20.903
It was a very
rare painting, Sam.

418
00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:24.730
Maybe... maybe that's the reason
why it looked so familiar to you.

419
00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:41.820
This is my sister, Magda.

420
00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:46.834
I was younger, but that's
the only picture survived.

421
00:36:46.919 --> 00:36:48.120
Mm.

422
00:36:48.597 --> 00:36:52.516
My uncle
commissioned the portrait

423
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:55.215
as a gift for her 12th birthday.

424
00:36:55.991 --> 00:36:58.342
It was a young artist,
just beginning.

425
00:36:58.413 --> 00:37:01.318
But oh, you should've seen it.

426
00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:03.037
Not just the resemblance

427
00:37:03.146 --> 00:37:06.001
but a spirit that shone through.

428
00:37:06.065 --> 00:37:09.339
It glowed, you know,
like a beacon.

429
00:37:10.909 --> 00:37:14.765
"My little brother," she'd say.
"My Sammy."

430
00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.245
I could never protect her.

431
00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:21.954
To lose her twice...

432
00:37:24.509 --> 00:37:26.459
I can't imagine it.

433
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.004
Hello, Susan.

434
00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:32.432
Hey, I had no idea you
were such an art lover.

435
00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:35.330
That information you wanted,
just came in.

436
00:37:35.355 --> 00:37:37.471
- Kinda surprising.
- Okay.

437
00:37:37.515 --> 00:37:39.314
- I'm sending it to you right now.
- Good.

438
00:37:39.776 --> 00:37:40.834
Yeah.

439
00:37:40.899 --> 00:37:43.313
Calbert's bank records are fine.

440
00:37:44.411 --> 00:37:46.624
Texts, emails.

441
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.599
No marital discord.

442
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.255
No girlfriends, no boyfriends,
no lovers.

443
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.779
Not even an inappropriate
message to a co-worker.

444
00:37:53.822 --> 00:37:55.335
And what about the wife?

445
00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:58.382
Oh, come on, Dave,
women fuck around too.

446
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.327
I mean, think about it.

447
00:38:03.441 --> 00:38:05.640
When's the last time you
sent your wife flowers, hmm?

448
00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:07.430
Noted. Noted.

449
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:14.408
Data on Calbert's
hard drive just came in.

450
00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.218
No, we'll talk about it
on the plane.

451
00:38:16.289 --> 00:38:17.931
I wanna get outta here
as soon as we can,

452
00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.713
run something through
his best hand.

453
00:38:27.937 --> 00:38:29.801
All right, watch it.

454
00:38:30.731 --> 00:38:33.800
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Pardon.

455
00:38:33.942 --> 00:38:35.133
Merci.

456
00:38:53.918 --> 00:38:56.510
- I'll see you downstairs at 6:00?
- You got it.

457
00:38:56.788 --> 00:38:58.194
Oh, and hey, how
'bout some of that

458
00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.226
delicious Belgian chocolate
you're always talkin' about?

459
00:39:00.306 --> 00:39:02.100
Or you'll not gettin' on
the plane.

460
00:39:04.832 --> 00:39:06.760
Guess I'm goin' back out.

461
00:39:23.043 --> 00:39:24.581
Oh, crap.

462
00:39:30.232 --> 00:39:31.505
Oh, good.

463
00:39:42.372 --> 00:39:43.771
W-What do you want?!

464
00:39:43.877 --> 00:39:44.957
Let me go!

465
00:39:56.919 --> 00:39:58.652
What do you fucking want?

466
00:39:58.815 --> 00:40:00.527
Who the fuck are you?

467
00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:01.926
Come on!

468
00:40:35.606 --> 00:40:37.636
We could make this pop out.

469
00:40:38.073 --> 00:40:40.073
Picasso this entire buildin'.

470
00:40:40.272 --> 00:40:41.643
Picasso it?

471
00:40:41.764 --> 00:40:43.787
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay. How much?

472
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.796
It's on the house.

473
00:40:45.954 --> 00:40:47.275
I like that.

474
00:40:53.653 --> 00:40:55.401
Been drawin' a long time?

475
00:40:55.465 --> 00:40:58.896
Since uh, about third grade.

476
00:40:59.412 --> 00:41:00.934
What is this?

477
00:41:02.896 --> 00:41:04.910
That's how I sign my work.

478
00:41:06.185 --> 00:41:08.356
My brother, he was a boxer.

479
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.693
It's the right hand o' God.

480
00:41:11.389 --> 00:41:13.925
He catch you with it,
you know...

481
00:41:14.095 --> 00:41:16.769
You go to heaven, or uh...

482
00:41:18.195 --> 00:41:19.344
Okay.

483
00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:23.784
- He still fightin'?
- Ah...

484
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.916
Somebody shot him

485
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:29.526
comin' back from the gym.

486
00:41:29.665 --> 00:41:32.125
Not even ganged up on
or nothin'.

487
00:41:32.898 --> 00:41:34.781
Just wanted his gym bag.

488
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.266
What?

489
00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.364
I didn't say anything.

490
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.928
Anyway.

491
00:41:52.617 --> 00:41:55.337
My grandmother says
if you don't

492
00:41:55.572 --> 00:41:57.475
remember somebody out loud,

493
00:41:57.606 --> 00:41:59.655
they die twice.

494
00:42:03.697 --> 00:42:05.968
Your grandmother was wise.
Hey, Brian.

495
00:42:06.251 --> 00:42:08.297
Yeah, listen, I'm-I'm reading
your book right now.

496
00:42:08.333 --> 00:42:09.882
I can't believe you...

497
00:42:26.355 --> 00:42:27.484
Yeah.

498
00:42:37.031 --> 00:42:38.435
Yeah.

499
00:42:41.723 --> 00:42:42.991
Got it.

500
00:42:47.505 --> 00:42:49.198
Yo, Mr. McCall, you good?

501
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:52.534
Hey, yo, Mr. McCall!

502
00:43:39.196 --> 00:43:40.570
Thanks, Dave.

503
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.490
The police from Brussels said

504
00:44:05.611 --> 00:44:08.927
it happens in these hotels,
these robberies.

505
00:44:09.972 --> 00:44:12.485
But she never wore any jewelry.

506
00:44:14.135 --> 00:44:16.228
Not even a watch.

507
00:44:20.146 --> 00:44:21.566
Except for this.

508
00:44:31.729 --> 00:44:33.357
What'd the agency say?

509
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:36.475
They said...

510
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.067
They'd do everything
in their power.

511
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.050
They're working with Interpol.

512
00:44:44.361 --> 00:44:46.865
Promised to find
whoever it was.

513
00:44:48.907 --> 00:44:50.067
But...

514
00:44:54.062 --> 00:44:55.956
I don't know what to do now.

515
00:48:11.787 --> 00:48:15.236
<i>Things to remember as the storm
continues its march north...</i>

516
00:48:15.314 --> 00:48:18.056
<i>as we saw what Frances did to the
southeast part of the country.</i>

517
00:48:18.177 --> 00:48:20.506
<i>It appears to be
moving here as slowly</i>

518
00:48:20.534 --> 00:48:22.239
<i>as it left the Gulf Coast.</i>

519
00:48:22.339 --> 00:48:24.639
<i>That is what worries
meteorologists now.</i>

520
00:48:24.717 --> 00:48:27.392
<i>Even as the storm is moving
up the Eastern Seaboard,</i>

521
00:48:27.417 --> 00:48:30.143
<i>every city and town
that has been hit</i>

522
00:48:30.198 --> 00:48:32.187
<i>has experienced storm surge...</i>

523
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.574
<i>Dangerous flood levels.</i>

524
00:49:19.544 --> 00:49:22.377
<i>Excusez-moi monsieur.
Pardon.</i>

525
00:49:22.555 --> 00:49:24.167
<i>Merci.</i>

526
00:49:32.733 --> 00:49:34.843
<i>Excusez-moi monsieur.</i>

527
00:49:37.263 --> 00:49:39.496
<i>- I'll see you downstairs at 6:00?
- You got it.</i>

528
00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.580
<i>- I'll see you downstairs at 6:00?
- You got it.</i>

529
00:50:08.512 --> 00:50:10.329
You got fat, Dave.

530
00:50:32.473 --> 00:50:36.639
I was in the same lobby
when that bomb went off.

531
00:50:36.852 --> 00:50:38.819
Looking right at you.

532
00:50:40.353 --> 00:50:42.363
When that hotel
came down on us.

533
00:50:46.304 --> 00:50:48.095
You were there
and then you weren't.

534
00:50:50.156 --> 00:50:51.745
Wasn't my day.

535
00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:56.172
I went to your funeral.

536
00:50:56.646 --> 00:50:58.069
Grieved...

537
00:50:58.565 --> 00:51:00.483
A long time over you.

538
00:51:04.301 --> 00:51:06.101
Susan, she knew?

539
00:51:09.182 --> 00:51:10.930
I was your partner for
seven years, Mac.

540
00:51:10.966 --> 00:51:12.443
I never kept anything from you.

541
00:51:12.496 --> 00:51:13.970
I'm sorry, Dave.

542
00:51:14.417 --> 00:51:15.589
I am.

543
00:51:18.523 --> 00:51:21.207
I never had a chance
to say how sorry I was.

544
00:51:22.631 --> 00:51:24.297
About Vivian.

545
00:51:24.532 --> 00:51:25.789
Well...

546
00:51:28.014 --> 00:51:29.830
You still at the beach?

547
00:51:31.287 --> 00:51:33.082
Not in a long time.

548
00:51:34.055 --> 00:51:35.781
Well, I got me that cabin.

549
00:51:37.696 --> 00:51:40.334
Take the wife and kids up
couple times a year.

550
00:51:42.485 --> 00:51:44.190
Wouldn't have any of it...

551
00:51:46.081 --> 00:51:47.734
If it weren't for Susan.

552
00:51:50.586 --> 00:51:51.975
Life got...

553
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.981
Dark.

554
00:51:57.853 --> 00:52:00.363
She talked me off that ledge
I was heading over.

555
00:52:01.015 --> 00:52:03.423
Probably over a bowl of soup.

556
00:52:03.545 --> 00:52:04.930
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:52:08.806 --> 00:52:10.426
I owe her my life.

558
00:52:12.811 --> 00:52:14.780
Ever talk to the boys?

559
00:52:15.725 --> 00:52:17.209
No, not for years.

560
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.800
Hell of a team we were, right?

561
00:52:26.165 --> 00:52:28.065
She never pushed
the button, Dave.

562
00:52:28.184 --> 00:52:30.084
- Who?
- Susan.

563
00:52:30.843 --> 00:52:32.230
On the elevator.

564
00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:34.743
She never pushed
her floor number.

565
00:52:34.808 --> 00:52:36.464
I checked all the video.

566
00:52:37.501 --> 00:52:39.526
Backpackers got on the first.

567
00:52:39.706 --> 00:52:42.663
They pushed number 16,
she didn't have to.

568
00:52:44.221 --> 00:52:46.172
They knew what floor
she was on.

569
00:52:47.759 --> 00:52:49.374
You find them?

570
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:51.989
Pieces of them.

571
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.911
Couple of tweakers
with sheets as long as my arm.

572
00:52:56.066 --> 00:52:58.389
My good arm, anyway.

573
00:52:59.078 --> 00:53:00.812
Gas explosion.

574
00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.296
At least that's what
they're calling it.

575
00:53:02.332 --> 00:53:03.908
What do you call it?

576
00:53:05.352 --> 00:53:07.070
Tying up loose ends.

577
00:53:10.358 --> 00:53:12.292
Autopsy report:

578
00:53:12.371 --> 00:53:14.362
Stab wound...

579
00:53:15.585 --> 00:53:18.179
Two millimeters
below her third rib.

580
00:53:18.379 --> 00:53:20.313
- Close quarter technique...
- Exactly.

581
00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:22.732
That was taught.
This was no robbery.

582
00:53:24.672 --> 00:53:26.867
Something else went on
in the room.

583
00:53:44.892 --> 00:53:46.497
What's the word, bro?

584
00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.258
York.

585
00:56:52.292 --> 00:56:53.486
Dave.

586
00:56:55.428 --> 00:56:57.464
Listen, the gun...

587
00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:01.541
next to Calbert
was on his right side.

588
00:57:04.752 --> 00:57:06.605
He was right-handed.
Why?

589
00:57:06.669 --> 00:57:09.489
His wife was shot by
somebody left-handed.

590
00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:12.152
Somebody else
was in that room.

591
00:57:14.052 --> 00:57:16.669
Powder residue came
from the latex glove.

592
00:57:17.401 --> 00:57:21.790
20,000 euros were found
in the backpackers' flat.

593
00:57:22.785 --> 00:57:24.461
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey.

594
00:57:27.528 --> 00:57:29.190
Those guys were set up.

595
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:31.740
Right. Agency assets
are taken out all the time.

596
00:57:31.772 --> 00:57:35.657
Opposite side loves...
sending a message.

597
00:57:36.437 --> 00:57:37.908
Why stage it?

598
00:57:39.343 --> 00:57:41.232
They didn't know
he was one of ours.

599
00:57:41.407 --> 00:57:44.244
Susan was about to figure out
who was in that room.

600
00:57:44.377 --> 00:57:46.239
That's why she was killed, Dave.

601
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:47.887
The two are connected.

602
00:57:48.414 --> 00:57:50.927
I'll call get back to you
when I know more.

603
00:57:51.699 --> 00:57:53.370
Keep me posted.

604
00:58:59.709 --> 00:59:01.577
Yo, man, elevator's closed.

605
00:59:15.462 --> 00:59:18.402
Listen up, little nigga,
you ready to put in work?

606
00:59:18.466 --> 00:59:20.391
'Cause everybody in
my camp put his work.

607
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:22.976
Ain't no bullshit.

608
01:00:00.982 --> 01:00:02.686
Pass that blunt.

609
01:00:12.325 --> 01:00:13.447
You sure?

610
01:00:13.994 --> 01:00:15.360
Listen, man.

611
01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:17.460
You know you gotta
spin the bin tonight, right?

612
01:00:17.602 --> 01:00:19.087
You know you gotta
spin the bin.

613
01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.250
Didn't them niggas
kill your brother?

614
01:00:22.187 --> 01:00:23.387
Yeah.

615
01:00:23.934 --> 01:00:26.200
Right. Gotta go take
care of that tonight.

616
01:00:26.236 --> 01:00:27.720
Run down on them niggas.

617
01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:29.778
Make sure you kill one
them L niggas tonight.

618
01:00:30.446 --> 01:00:32.372
Make sure you empty
that whole thing.

619
01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:37.130
Yo, listen, your mother
already buried your brother.

620
01:00:37.648 --> 01:00:39.907
Do have her bury two sons.

621
01:00:40.689 --> 01:00:42.978
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

622
01:00:43.078 --> 01:00:44.819
Don't come back
without it empty.

623
01:00:44.967 --> 01:00:46.409
That's a fact, B.

624
01:00:47.942 --> 01:00:49.051
Shit.

625
01:00:49.295 --> 01:00:50.919
- Let's go, Miles.
- Oh, shit!

626
01:00:50.997 --> 01:00:52.765
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down.

627
01:00:52.836 --> 01:00:54.477
Who the fuck is this nigga?

628
01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.679
I'm your father, your momma
just didn't tell you.

629
01:00:56.806 --> 01:00:58.162
Let's go, Miles.

630
01:00:58.376 --> 01:01:00.251
Let's go, Miles.

631
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.692
Let's go, Miles!

632
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.974
Where you goin'?

633
01:01:11.414 --> 01:01:12.724
Yeah?

634
01:01:15.708 --> 01:01:16.840
Bang.

635
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:18.625
Yo, who the fuck was that, yo?

636
01:01:18.813 --> 01:01:20.487
Look at this shit here!

637
01:01:20.723 --> 01:01:23.064
Yo, what the fuck happened, yo?
What the fuck is goin' on, yo?

638
01:01:23.199 --> 01:01:25.826
- Come on!
- Get the fuck off of me, man!

639
01:01:27.158 --> 01:01:28.318
Huh?

640
01:01:29.342 --> 01:01:31.435
- You know where the fuck we at?
- I know. Do you?

641
01:01:31.471 --> 01:01:33.520
I know where we are.
This what you want?

642
01:01:33.904 --> 01:01:35.473
Is it what you want?
I thought you want to draw.

643
01:01:35.498 --> 01:01:36.710
Isn't that what you said?

644
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.272
- Draw?
- Yeah.

645
01:01:38.456 --> 01:01:40.722
- Paint?
- Yeah!

646
01:01:41.594 --> 01:01:43.385
What the fuck is that
gonna get me?

647
01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.865
That shit 'bout to
put food in my fuckin' Ma's table?

648
01:01:47.881 --> 01:01:49.139
Huh?

649
01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:51.937
That shit gon' pay
the fuckin' bills?

650
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:54.643
Nah.

651
01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:56.755
You need to be a gangsta.
You need to be a killer.

652
01:01:56.819 --> 01:01:58.879
A little yummy, huh?
You need them.

653
01:01:59.265 --> 01:02:00.669
Okay, if that's what you want.

654
01:02:01.002 --> 01:02:03.850
If that's what makes you feel
like a man, then be a real man.

655
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:05.606
Let's get jumped in
right now, here.

656
01:02:05.683 --> 01:02:06.791
- Start with me.
- No.

657
01:02:06.879 --> 01:02:08.801
No, start with me.
Here, start with me.

658
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.953
- No, take it.
- No.

659
01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:11.430
Come on, killer.
Come on, killer.

660
01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.213
Come on, killer.
Do it right there.

661
01:02:13.412 --> 01:02:14.747
You know how to hold it?

662
01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:16.897
You know what you doin'?
Come on, killer.

663
01:02:17.216 --> 01:02:18.744
There you go.

664
01:02:19.214 --> 01:02:20.420
There you go.

665
01:02:20.866 --> 01:02:22.159
There you go.

666
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.521
Five pounds of pressure,
that's all it takes.

667
01:02:27.024 --> 01:02:28.267
Come on, gangsta.

668
01:02:28.427 --> 01:02:30.441
Five pounds of pressure,
that's all it takes.

669
01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:33.651
Five pounds of pressure,
that's all it takes.

670
01:02:35.226 --> 01:02:37.413
Alright, c'mon, give it to me.
You don't want, give it to me.

671
01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:38.983
C'mon, give it to me.

672
01:02:39.027 --> 01:02:40.589
I ain't gonna do nothin' to you.

673
01:02:41.107 --> 01:02:43.891
See, you know what they are
up there? They're liars.

674
01:02:43.963 --> 01:02:45.178
And so am I.

675
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.332
Hey, yo, yo, yo!

676
01:02:46.357 --> 01:02:47.858
See what happens when
you deal with a liar?

677
01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.005
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Huh?

678
01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:50.774
You see what happens
when you deal with a liar?

679
01:02:50.824 --> 01:02:52.344
I lied to your little punk ass.

680
01:02:52.386 --> 01:02:53.913
- Aight!
- Now, I'ma kill you.

681
01:02:53.992 --> 01:02:55.285
What do you see when
you look at me? Tell me.

682
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.479
You better give me a right
answer. What do you see

683
01:02:56.514 --> 01:02:57.842
- when you look at me?
- I do not know!

684
01:02:57.867 --> 01:02:59.562
- Killer! What you see, yummy?
- I do not know, I don't know.

685
01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:00.975
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

686
01:03:01.295 --> 01:03:02.488
I don't know.

687
01:03:03.066 --> 01:03:04.082
Aight.

688
01:03:04.131 --> 01:03:06.039
Man ain't spelled g-u-n, son.

689
01:03:09.335 --> 01:03:11.063
You got a choice.

690
01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:12.839
You got talent.

691
01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.188
You got a chance.

692
01:03:14.238 --> 01:03:15.423
And I don't wanna hear
about your environment.

693
01:03:15.484 --> 01:03:16.717
And what your momma
didn't give you.

694
01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:18.122
And the white man won't
give you no shot.

695
01:03:18.187 --> 01:03:19.579
You got a chance.

696
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:22.150
Use it while you're still alive!

697
01:03:22.348 --> 01:03:24.316
You don't know what death is!

698
01:03:24.777 --> 01:03:27.384
You have no idea
what death is!

699
01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:31.389
Make a decision.

700
01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.832
Alright.

701
01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.179
Hey, yo, Mr. McCall!

702
01:03:43.642 --> 01:03:45.716
- Why me?
- Why not you?

703
01:03:51.968 --> 01:03:53.806
But... But why me?

704
01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:57.094
Let's find out together.

705
01:04:02.659 --> 01:04:05.351
<i>And with a storm this size, that
surge could be as much as six feet.</i>

706
01:04:05.422 --> 01:04:07.127
<i>It's the speed of the hurricane</i>

707
01:04:07.253 --> 01:04:11.089
<i>and that giant eye that could
absolutely deluge the coast.</i>

708
01:04:33.827 --> 01:04:34.914
Hello?

709
01:04:35.076 --> 01:04:36.725
Mr. McCall?

710
01:04:38.252 --> 01:04:39.267
Who is it?

711
01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:40.780
It's me, Miles.

712
01:04:44.736 --> 01:04:47.264
- I finished the bricks outside.
- Yeah, I saw it.

713
01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:51.142
Oh, uh...

714
01:04:51.362 --> 01:04:53.450
Here's your change
for the extra paint.

715
01:04:54.246 --> 01:04:56.555
- That's all of it?
- Yeah.

716
01:04:58.444 --> 01:05:00.646
So, anyway, uh...

717
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:04.204
You have somethin' to drink?

718
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:05.596
Yes, I do.

719
01:05:07.819 --> 01:05:09.090
Would you like
somethin' to drink?

720
01:05:09.126 --> 01:05:10.163
Yeah.

721
01:05:10.227 --> 01:05:11.483
Come on in.

722
01:05:14.427 --> 01:05:16.096
Iced tea or water?

723
01:05:16.174 --> 01:05:18.518
Tss, what do I look like,
Jackie Chan?

724
01:05:25.304 --> 01:05:27.154
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

725
01:05:30.185 --> 01:05:32.176
You know they
sell these in sets.

726
01:05:32.893 --> 01:05:34.157
Yeah.

727
01:05:47.262 --> 01:05:48.547
What you makin'?

728
01:05:48.618 --> 01:05:49.954
Arroz con pollo.

729
01:05:51.497 --> 01:05:53.661
- Yo, Moms makes the same thing.
- Does she?

730
01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:54.907
Yeah, she puts some...

731
01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:56.626
I'm not your moms.

732
01:05:57.303 --> 01:05:58.977
And that's not your pot.

733
01:05:59.336 --> 01:06:00.837
And this is not your house.

734
01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.330
- You understand? Okay.
- Yeah.

735
01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:14.914
Yo, this wall need a paint job.

736
01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:16.171
Yeah, it does.

737
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:17.479
Yeah.

738
01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:19.935
- I could do it for you.
- Could you?

739
01:06:20.206 --> 01:06:21.230
Yeah.

740
01:06:21.264 --> 01:06:22.419
How much?

741
01:06:24.566 --> 01:06:26.490
If I could get
a plate of that food.

742
01:06:27.798 --> 01:06:29.367
Tss, yeah, man.

743
01:06:30.447 --> 01:06:31.960
No, seriously, uh...

744
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:33.941
115.

745
01:06:34.227 --> 01:06:35.521
That cool?

746
01:06:36.452 --> 01:06:38.391
All right, I'll make
a deal with you.

747
01:06:40.678 --> 01:06:41.874
115, huh?

748
01:06:41.939 --> 01:06:43.147
Yeah.

749
01:06:43.647 --> 01:06:45.514
Here you go. Free.

750
01:06:46.651 --> 01:06:48.398
Read that.
Can you read?

751
01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.485
- Yeah.
- What's it say?

752
01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:54.776
Ta-Nehisi Coates,
<i>Between the World and Me.</i>

753
01:06:54.883 --> 01:06:56.857
All right. You read that,
we got a deal.

754
01:07:02.243 --> 01:07:04.026
- Airport?
- Yeah.

755
01:07:04.581 --> 01:07:06.534
Is it somebody's birthday?

756
01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:09.382
- My daughter.
- Nice.

757
01:07:13.251 --> 01:07:14.978
How old is she?

758
01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.102
She's five.

759
01:08:15.621 --> 01:08:17.809
Guess you don't fly
that often, huh?

760
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:21.092
Been drivin' in the
opposite direction of Logan

761
01:08:21.128 --> 01:08:22.747
for the last three minutes.

762
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:55.075
Hey!

763
01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.113
No crust, please, Mom.

764
01:10:56.268 --> 01:10:57.576
- Mom?
- Eat up, sweetie.

765
01:10:57.637 --> 01:10:59.081
Why do I have to go
to the dentist

766
01:10:59.124 --> 01:11:00.539
I never had to go
to the dentist.

767
01:11:00.603 --> 01:11:01.907
Gotta be the gardener.

768
01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.124
- Grapes.
- You know where the grapes are?

769
01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:09.966
Oh, my God.

770
01:11:10.196 --> 01:11:13.117
My life is so hard.

771
01:11:13.217 --> 01:11:14.417
Here's your grapes.

772
01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:17.471
Come on, show me
what you can do.

773
01:11:17.563 --> 01:11:18.714
But... seriously?

774
01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:20.262
Seriously.

775
01:11:21.414 --> 01:11:22.607
Hi, baby.

776
01:11:24.936 --> 01:11:26.772
Mommy made a nice map.

777
01:11:28.233 --> 01:11:30.037
A: Miane, very good.

778
01:11:30.269 --> 01:11:31.912
B: New hams...

779
01:11:32.963 --> 01:11:34.213
New Hamster.

780
01:11:34.569 --> 01:11:36.657
Carol, who is it?

781
01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:43.691
Carol?

782
01:11:44.295 --> 01:11:46.442
It's New Hampshire,
not New hamster.

783
01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:49.344
But I like it as New hamster.

784
01:11:50.246 --> 01:11:51.489
Okay, we'll leave it...

785
01:11:51.552 --> 01:11:53.393
Honey, the front
doorbell's broken.

786
01:11:53.449 --> 01:11:54.920
Your old Army buddy
was at the back door

787
01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:56.220
for almost five minutes.

788
01:11:56.328 --> 01:11:59.182
Actually, I was his team leader.
Seven years.

789
01:11:59.618 --> 01:12:03.419
Oh, my... Baby, I'm so sorry
I must've forgot. This is...

790
01:12:03.503 --> 01:12:04.861
I got the days mixed up.

791
01:12:04.941 --> 01:12:07.079
This is Robert McCall,
this is my wife, Carol.

792
01:12:07.146 --> 01:12:09.058
- Hi.
- Hi, pleasure to meet you, Robert.

793
01:12:09.308 --> 01:12:11.743
These are our daughters,
Molly, Alice.

794
01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:13.082
- Come here baby, come here.
- How are you?

795
01:12:13.106 --> 01:12:14.250
- Say hi to...
- Please make yourself at home.

796
01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:16.068
- Oh, thank you.
- Call him Mac.

797
01:12:16.104 --> 01:12:18.604
- Do you want some coffee?
- Uh, no, I'm fine, thank you.

798
01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.223
Sorry about the mess,
we were just...

799
01:12:20.351 --> 01:12:21.622
- No problem, no problem.
- I gotta get...

800
01:12:21.665 --> 01:12:23.015
- these two off to school.
- Okay.

801
01:12:23.322 --> 01:12:25.721
Girls, let's go.
Out of these pajamas.

802
01:12:31.258 --> 01:12:33.453
- Robert, nice to meet you.
- Oh, my pleasure.

803
01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:35.772
- Sit down, come here.
- Yeah.

804
01:12:37.403 --> 01:12:39.380
- You all right?
- Yeah!

805
01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.236
You've got a beautiful family.

806
01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:47.420
Thanks. What's going on?

807
01:12:52.191 --> 01:12:55.410
I took this off the guy

808
01:12:55.673 --> 01:12:57.580
who tried to kill me yesterday.

809
01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:59.721
Just like you said,
they're cleaning up.

810
01:13:00.145 --> 01:13:02.100
Everybody's looking
to the Brussels hit.

811
01:13:02.181 --> 01:13:04.849
Nobody's safe.
You, your family.

812
01:13:05.452 --> 01:13:08.286
Nobody. That's
military-grade encryption.

813
01:13:08.548 --> 01:13:11.816
You should take it to the office,
run the numbers and uh...

814
01:13:12.011 --> 01:13:14.698
Check the names against the
passenger manifest

815
01:13:14.762 --> 01:13:18.199
in and out of Brussels in the
days surrounding the flight.

816
01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.990
Whoever we're looking for
may call through that phone.

817
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:22.816
I'm on it. I'm on it.

818
01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:54.447
Tell me I'm wrong, Dave.

819
01:13:56.449 --> 01:13:58.303
You gonna answer it?

820
01:14:03.707 --> 01:14:05.647
What happened, Dave?

821
01:14:11.507 --> 01:14:13.033
You died.

822
01:14:20.676 --> 01:14:22.260
That's what happened.

823
01:14:25.224 --> 01:14:28.560
Three months after you
disappeared,

824
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.690
the government shut us down.

825
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:34.220
I went private right after.

826
01:14:36.355 --> 01:14:39.206
Doing the same things you and
I did for God and country.

827
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:42.372
Killing names on a piece
of paper. Only now...

828
01:14:42.804 --> 01:14:44.615
Now there's
a price next to them.

829
01:14:44.673 --> 01:14:47.685
- We killed the enemy.
- Who said they were the enemy?

830
01:14:48.118 --> 01:14:49.943
Not us, not me.

831
01:14:52.086 --> 01:14:53.757
We just followed orders.

832
01:14:57.202 --> 01:15:00.824
Mac, there are no good
and bad people.

833
01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:02.337
Any more, no.

834
01:15:02.502 --> 01:15:05.951
No enemies, just...

835
01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.020
Unfortunates.

836
01:15:09.275 --> 01:15:10.830
And Susan?

837
01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:14.794
Unfortunate.

838
01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:23.928
No one knew the Brussels contract
was a deep agency asset.

839
01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.340
Susan was gonna figure out
who was in that dining room.

840
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.996
She was the only one
who could have, right?

841
01:15:32.511 --> 01:15:35.149
Until you crawled
out of your grave.

842
01:15:40.106 --> 01:15:42.116
Did you get the chocolate?

843
01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:44.106
Yeah?

844
01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:07.214
Susan worked in a
dangerous world, Mac.

845
01:16:09.287 --> 01:16:11.191
Coulda happened anytime
by anybody.

846
01:16:11.255 --> 01:16:12.549
It wasn't anybody, it was you.

847
01:16:12.589 --> 01:16:13.933
Just...

848
01:16:18.628 --> 01:16:21.078
You spare me the righteous
bullshit, all right?

849
01:16:23.508 --> 01:16:25.744
You do what you have to do
and you move on.

850
01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:28.251
There's no movin' on
from this, Dave.

851
01:16:28.663 --> 01:16:30.237
- We all gotta pay for our sins.
- Oh, yeah?

852
01:16:30.262 --> 01:16:32.321
What about you? Do you
deserve to die for yours?

853
01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:33.621
A hundred times over.

854
01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:35.241
Oh, all right.

855
01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:37.437
Well, guess what?

856
01:16:37.579 --> 01:16:39.324
There is no sin.

857
01:16:42.271 --> 01:16:43.787
No virtue.

858
01:16:46.271 --> 01:16:48.879
There's just shit people do.

859
01:16:51.168 --> 01:16:53.329
They trained us to kill people.

860
01:16:54.021 --> 01:16:55.569
And risk our lives doing it.

861
01:16:55.683 --> 01:16:57.487
And then one day,
you get a call saying,

862
01:16:57.578 --> 01:16:59.681
They're done with you.
Thank you for your service.

863
01:16:59.788 --> 01:17:01.365
Here's a plaque.

864
01:17:01.509 --> 01:17:03.439
You need a job?
Good luck.

865
01:17:03.695 --> 01:17:06.535
Need medical insurance?
See the V.A.

866
01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:11.849
One day, you're an asset.

867
01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.797
The next, you're a
fucking afterthought.

868
01:17:19.351 --> 01:17:22.156
It was a natural evolution.
It's who we were.

869
01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:25.629
It's what we did.
It's what you did.

870
01:17:26.362 --> 01:17:28.003
Now it's what we do.

871
01:17:28.074 --> 01:17:29.268
We?

872
01:17:31.136 --> 01:17:32.903
It's not just me, Mac.

873
01:17:35.219 --> 01:17:36.497
It's all of us.

874
01:17:36.597 --> 01:17:39.678
Ari, Resnik, Kovac.
All of us.

875
01:17:41.434 --> 01:17:42.917
Family?

876
01:18:03.061 --> 01:18:04.284
Gentlemen.

877
01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:05.875
Mac.

878
01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:08.084
Looks pretty good
for a dead guy.

879
01:18:09.383 --> 01:18:11.798
We all want you to know,
none of this is uh...

880
01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:13.233
personal.

881
01:18:14.526 --> 01:18:16.990
What you do, what you
become is not my concern.

882
01:18:17.054 --> 01:18:19.959
The world is full of
so-called men like you.

883
01:18:20.023 --> 01:18:22.062
And in a perfect world,

884
01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:25.138
everything we do
comes with a price, but...

885
01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:28.757
This ain't a perfect world.
People do bad things.

886
01:18:29.131 --> 01:18:31.744
If you're lucky,
you get a chance to...

887
01:18:32.085 --> 01:18:34.648
set it right. But...

888
01:18:35.013 --> 01:18:37.257
Most of the time,
it goes unpunished.

889
01:18:39.011 --> 01:18:40.945
This ain't one of them times.

890
01:18:41.105 --> 01:18:43.577
The mistake you made
was you killed my friend.

891
01:18:43.706 --> 01:18:47.066
So, I'm gonna kill
each and every one of you.

892
01:18:47.319 --> 01:18:49.012
And the only disappointment
in it for me is that

893
01:18:49.097 --> 01:18:51.143
I only get to do it once.

894
01:18:54.473 --> 01:18:56.987
- Hey, Ari, fellas!
- Hey, Carol.

895
01:18:57.087 --> 01:18:58.436
Robert, hope to see you again!

896
01:18:58.522 --> 01:19:00.169
Nice to meet you, too!

897
01:19:01.427 --> 01:19:02.592
Uh...

898
01:19:03.046 --> 01:19:06.540
Dave said you could give me
a lift to the uh, station?

899
01:19:07.045 --> 01:19:09.013
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, Dad!

900
01:19:09.061 --> 01:19:11.689
Help and company?
Let's go!

901
01:19:12.994 --> 01:19:15.581
See? Help and company.

902
01:19:16.404 --> 01:19:17.689
You take the little ones.

903
01:19:17.812 --> 01:19:19.232
Okay.

904
01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:25.449
Come on.

905
01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.624
See you at work.

906
01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:52.169
Look, I don't think
my wife had a favorite.

907
01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.933
She never gave
who I thought to close.

908
01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.577
I'm fine.

909
01:20:00.656 --> 01:20:02.574
I'll bring something over
in the morning.

910
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.059
Who's comin' after me?

911
01:22:23.143 --> 01:22:25.022
The man who killed Susan.

912
01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:28.786
Why?

913
01:22:30.349 --> 01:22:32.145
Because you're a loose end.

914
01:23:03.461 --> 01:23:04.752
What's up, Miles?

915
01:23:04.872 --> 01:23:06.676
Hey, yo, what up, man?

916
01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:08.132
Where are you?

917
01:23:08.202 --> 01:23:09.992
Yeah, I'm at your crib, actually.

918
01:23:10.076 --> 01:23:11.677
All right, listen, son.
I don't have time right...

919
01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.559
Finishing up these walls.

920
01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.212
Going with the spearmint green.

921
01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:18.010
Yo, you got any food
around here? I'm starving.

922
01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.659
What's all that barking?

923
01:23:27.908 --> 01:23:30.166
Go to the window,
tell me what you see.

924
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:31.558
Yeah.

925
01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.149
Yeah, these dogs outside
goin' crazy.

926
01:23:35.203 --> 01:23:38.400
Listen, hey, out toward the street,
tell me what you see.

927
01:23:39.402 --> 01:23:42.065
Oh, it's just some dude
out here delivering pizza.

928
01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:43.904
Hang on.

929
01:24:13.696 --> 01:24:15.269
Hey, yo...

930
01:24:16.234 --> 01:24:17.826
Yo, Mr. McCall?

931
01:24:19.423 --> 01:24:20.560
Shit.

932
01:24:22.373 --> 01:24:23.593
Oh, shit.

933
01:24:25.034 --> 01:24:27.066
Hey, Mr. McCall, I think
somebody's tryin' to get in...

934
01:24:27.138 --> 01:24:28.755
Miles, listen to me real carefully.

935
01:24:28.798 --> 01:24:29.800
Go to the bedroom.

936
01:24:29.842 --> 01:24:31.795
Go to my bedroom,
you'll see a bookshelf.

937
01:24:31.852 --> 01:24:32.961
- Go.
- What?

938
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:34.048
Just go.

939
01:24:34.175 --> 01:24:35.539
- Hey, yo, what?
- Miles...

940
01:24:35.745 --> 01:24:37.236
- Aight.
- Miles...

941
01:24:37.343 --> 01:24:38.465
See it?

942
01:24:38.565 --> 01:24:40.390
- Yeah.
- All right.

943
01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:42.961
Middle shelf, there's a book
by Richard Wright,

944
01:24:43.003 --> 01:24:44.438
- <i>Native Son.</i>
- What?

945
01:24:44.474 --> 01:24:46.179
Listen, just do
what I tell you.

946
01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:47.478
- <i>Native Son, Native Son...</i>
- Just pull it out.

947
01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.104
- What, you want me to read it?
- Pull the book out.

948
01:24:49.162 --> 01:24:50.667
You'll see a button behind it.

949
01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:52.524
I want you to push the button.

950
01:24:59.056 --> 01:25:00.888
You're gonna push the button,
it'll open up.

951
01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.948
You go inside, you close
the door behind you.

952
01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:06.918
Aight.

953
01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:11.485
I'm in, I'm in.

954
01:25:36.481 --> 01:25:37.858
Yo, what is this place?

955
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:39.538
All right, calm down,
calm down.

956
01:25:39.584 --> 01:25:41.602
Just sit down, be quiet.

957
01:25:41.673 --> 01:25:43.627
Be very quiet, don't move.

958
01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:52.202
Hey, Mr. McCall...

959
01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:54.608
Yo, who are these people?

960
01:25:54.674 --> 01:25:55.973
Let me worry about that.

961
01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:09.881
Clear.

962
01:26:25.426 --> 01:26:28.161
Calm down. Get in the hole.
Go inside.

963
01:26:28.242 --> 01:26:29.461
Aight.

964
01:26:31.369 --> 01:26:33.907
Yo, man, I don't do well
in small spaces, man.

965
01:26:34.345 --> 01:26:37.252
- Yo, I can't even breathe.
- Son, son, slow down.

966
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:40.299
My fuckin' lungs is...
closin' up and shit.

967
01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:55.993
He's lookin' right at me.

968
01:26:56.043 --> 01:26:58.117
Don't worry about it.
It's a two-way mirror.

969
01:26:58.273 --> 01:26:59.928
You can see them,
they can't see you.

970
01:27:00.072 --> 01:27:01.796
It's too dark in here.

971
01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:04.111
Yo, I can't even feel my legs,
I can't see my feet.

972
01:27:04.145 --> 01:27:07.142
Relax, just breathe.
Don't talk too loud.

973
01:27:12.082 --> 01:27:14.724
Turn your phone off, they'll
see the light. Turn it off.

974
01:27:15.123 --> 01:27:16.365
Fuck.

975
01:27:21.101 --> 01:27:22.311
Fuck.

976
01:28:12.693 --> 01:28:14.165
How you doing, Dave?

977
01:28:14.952 --> 01:28:16.424
You know who it is.

978
01:28:16.722 --> 01:28:18.320
Listen, since
you're in my house,

979
01:28:18.349 --> 01:28:19.968
water my plants
for me, will you?

980
01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:21.850
'Cause I'm not gonna be
back for a while.

981
01:28:33.876 --> 01:28:36.154
It's a mistake to go to war
with us, McCall.

982
01:28:36.461 --> 01:28:39.430
You got it backwards, Dave.
You're going to war with me.

983
01:28:42.121 --> 01:28:43.830
You know where I'll be.

984
01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:21.921
I know where he's headed.

985
01:29:24.999 --> 01:29:26.829
He's goin' home.

986
01:30:34.152 --> 01:30:35.647
Hey, kid.

987
01:30:37.674 --> 01:30:38.944
Back up.

988
01:30:54.811 --> 01:30:56.032
The town's evacuated!

989
01:30:56.068 --> 01:30:57.929
How you doin', officer?
Just got off a double shift.

990
01:30:57.986 --> 01:30:59.662
Just gonna check and
see if I left my gas on.

991
01:30:59.726 --> 01:31:01.061
All right, make it quick.

992
01:31:02.406 --> 01:31:04.498
Let the gray BMW through.

993
01:31:04.683 --> 01:31:05.983
Copy that.

994
01:32:03.194 --> 01:32:04.693
What do we have here?

995
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.854
I need you to turn around.
Town's been evacuated.

996
01:32:48.361 --> 01:32:50.054
Where are you?

997
01:33:02.393 --> 01:33:03.825
Slow down.

998
01:33:10.368 --> 01:33:12.366
That was his wife's bakery.

999
01:33:12.792 --> 01:33:14.021
Go.

1000
01:33:18.206 --> 01:33:19.736
Pull over here.

1001
01:33:37.309 --> 01:33:40.441
Clear the alley.
Mac's house is back there.

1002
01:33:58.106 --> 01:34:00.017
Makin' entry. Yellow house.

1003
01:34:02.527 --> 01:34:04.348
All clear. Comin' out.

1004
01:34:17.275 --> 01:34:19.043
Taking high ground.

1005
01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:08.589
I got movement, 12:00.

1006
01:35:10.166 --> 01:35:11.452
Kovac, move in.

1007
01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.839
Ari, what's your sitrep?

1008
01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:16.658
Locking down south side.

1009
01:35:29.032 --> 01:35:31.091
Makin' entry, north side.

1010
01:37:01.648 --> 01:37:03.637
Kovac! Kovac!

1011
01:37:04.645 --> 01:37:06.322
Kovac! Come back.

1012
01:37:06.599 --> 01:37:09.162
Shots fired, shots fired.
I'm goin' in.

1013
01:37:09.284 --> 01:37:10.569
Goin' in!

1014
01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.466
York, you got eyes on him?

1015
01:37:12.543 --> 01:37:14.070
I see him.

1016
01:37:23.174 --> 01:37:25.099
Making entry, north side.

1017
01:37:26.714 --> 01:37:27.968
Fuck!

1018
01:37:36.702 --> 01:37:38.165
Ah, fuck!

1019
01:37:39.283 --> 01:37:41.880
- Kovac's down. He's gone.
- Say again.

1020
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:44.508
Kovac! He's down!
He's fucked!

1021
01:37:45.409 --> 01:37:47.803
Push towards the ocean.

1022
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:50.259
Repeat. Push towards
the ocean.

1023
01:38:34.505 --> 01:38:36.410
What the fuck?

1024
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:20.279
Ari? Resnik?

1025
01:39:20.414 --> 01:39:22.233
Somebody talk to me.

1026
01:39:22.595 --> 01:39:23.994
Ari!

1027
01:39:25.557 --> 01:39:27.090
Son of a bitch!

1028
01:39:37.525 --> 01:39:39.021
Ari is down!

1029
01:39:39.455 --> 01:39:40.769
Ari is down!

1030
01:39:40.931 --> 01:39:42.601
Just like the fucking
rest of them!

1031
01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.886
There're pictures of
Susan everywhere!

1032
01:39:47.010 --> 01:39:48.807
Picking us apart, man!

1033
01:39:49.569 --> 01:39:51.138
I need fuckin' eyes!

1034
01:40:45.118 --> 01:40:47.768
I'm in the southwest corner
of the yellow building.

1035
01:40:47.836 --> 01:40:49.030
I got a blood trail.

1036
01:40:49.102 --> 01:40:50.956
Looks like he's headed
across the main drag.

1037
01:40:51.028 --> 01:40:52.405
Rear of the bakery.

1038
01:40:52.764 --> 01:40:54.087
Copy that.

1039
01:41:57.476 --> 01:42:00.050
Move inside, Resnik.
Move inside.

1040
01:42:52.493 --> 01:42:54.155
Resnik, do you copy?

1041
01:42:55.774 --> 01:42:57.109
Resnik?

1042
01:42:57.876 --> 01:42:59.283
Come back!

1043
01:43:13.375 --> 01:43:14.639
Fuck!

1044
01:43:28.450 --> 01:43:30.339
Just me and you, Dave.
Nobody's left.

1045
01:43:30.666 --> 01:43:32.312
Not exactly.

1046
01:43:42.291 --> 01:43:44.272
Remember what you taught me.

1047
01:43:44.855 --> 01:43:47.398
Always have
a contingency plan.

1048
01:43:54.028 --> 01:43:55.420
Come on, Mac!

1049
01:43:56.774 --> 01:43:58.189
Show yourself.

1050
01:44:22.303 --> 01:44:24.343
I don't know
who the kid is, Mac.

1051
01:44:24.399 --> 01:44:26.090
Or if he means anything to you.

1052
01:44:26.781 --> 01:44:29.101
I took the chance
that he matters.

1053
01:44:31.026 --> 01:44:33.008
I'll make it simple.
Step out.

1054
01:44:33.082 --> 01:44:35.870
Show yourself
and I won't kill the kid.

1055
01:44:49.044 --> 01:44:51.147
The wind makes it interesting.

1056
01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:54.449
Side mirror.

1057
01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:59.605
Two more. Third one goes
to the middle of the trunk.

1058
01:45:07.236 --> 01:45:08.561
Tail light.

1059
01:45:11.054 --> 01:45:13.746
I was a hair off on that one.
I might've hit the kid.

1060
01:45:19.725 --> 01:45:22.560
All right! Time's up, Mac!

1061
01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.374
Nice move, Mac.

1062
01:45:36.945 --> 01:45:38.817
But it's not gonna
make any difference.

1063
01:45:41.939 --> 01:45:44.009
Where are you?
You son of a bitch!

1064
01:46:15.089 --> 01:46:16.744
Fuck you, Mac!

1065
01:46:17.626 --> 01:46:19.267
Fuck you!

1066
01:46:19.714 --> 01:46:21.478
You couldn't save your wife!

1067
01:46:21.739 --> 01:46:23.784
You couldn't save Susan!

1068
01:46:24.159 --> 01:46:26.809
And you're not gonna save
this fuckin' kid!

1069
01:46:27.717 --> 01:46:29.558
Is that in your playbook?

1070
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:32.193
Is that in your
fucking playbook?

1071
01:46:32.381 --> 01:46:34.242
Show yourself!

1072
01:48:23.178 --> 01:48:24.392
All right.

1073
01:48:25.084 --> 01:48:26.346
Right here.

1074
01:48:26.807 --> 01:48:28.270
Sit down right here.

1075
01:48:52.132 --> 01:48:53.460
Here you go.

1076
01:48:54.284 --> 01:48:55.463
Let's see.

1077
01:48:58.559 --> 01:49:00.312
Yeah, it went in and out.

1078
01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:01.855
It's not bad.

1079
01:49:05.454 --> 01:49:06.897
- Hey, yo...
- Yeah?

1080
01:49:07.210 --> 01:49:09.120
My moms is gonna be pissed.

1081
01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:10.853
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

1082
01:49:11.770 --> 01:49:13.333
Yo, not a me, man.

1083
01:49:13.473 --> 01:49:15.633
- At you.
- You talk to her, then.

1084
01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.948
All right.

1085
01:49:17.345 --> 01:49:19.028
Count to three.
One, two,

1086
01:49:19.071 --> 01:49:20.463
- three.
- Three.

1087
01:49:22.984 --> 01:49:24.880
- It's all good.
- Yep.

1088
01:49:24.973 --> 01:49:26.159
I got your back.

1089
01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:27.515
Appreciate it.

1090
01:49:28.467 --> 01:49:31.083
- Hey, Mr. McCall.
- Yeah.

1091
01:49:32.482 --> 01:49:34.078
Who are you, man?

1092
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:31.419
- Hey, Mr. McCall.
- Yeah.

1093
01:50:32.136 --> 01:50:33.926
I think the bleedin' stopped.

1094
01:50:34.456 --> 01:50:36.277
Well, good, good.

1095
01:50:40.754 --> 01:50:41.966
Sit down.

1096
01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.805
This your place?

1097
01:50:44.134 --> 01:50:45.446
Yes, it is.

1098
01:50:46.267 --> 01:50:47.541
Come on, sit down.

1099
01:51:35.664 --> 01:51:37.375
What are you drawing?

1100
01:51:39.648 --> 01:51:41.438
I'm uh...

1101
01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:45.054
Workin' on a
superhero character.

1102
01:51:45.998 --> 01:51:48.498
- What's his power?
- What's his power?

1103
01:51:50.001 --> 01:51:52.113
He knows things
before you do.

1104
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:54.521
He has uh...

1105
01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:57.604
secret rooms, magic locks.

1106
01:51:58.161 --> 01:51:59.947
You know, shit like that.

1107
01:52:00.097 --> 01:52:02.085
St-Stuff like that.

1108
01:52:02.551 --> 01:52:03.939
He fly?

1109
01:52:04.730 --> 01:52:05.863
Nah.

1110
01:52:06.026 --> 01:52:08.903
He actu-actually drives a Malibu.

1111
01:52:09.450 --> 01:52:10.985
That's funny?

1112
01:52:11.776 --> 01:52:14.095
Honestly?
That's cool.

1113
01:52:15.058 --> 01:52:16.287
I love it.

1114
01:52:16.386 --> 01:52:18.446
Respect. I appreciate that.

1115
01:52:57.853 --> 01:53:00.371
So, so, you can understand

1116
01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:03.589
that when a resident uh, says

1117
01:53:04.051 --> 01:53:08.326
things that are um,
grandiose by nature,

1118
01:53:10.172 --> 01:53:12.324
we tend to dismiss it.

1119
01:53:12.744 --> 01:53:14.853
So, you can imagine how um...

1120
01:53:15.298 --> 01:53:17.658
surprised we were today when

1121
01:53:17.822 --> 01:53:19.533
uh, when um...

1122
01:53:19.734 --> 01:53:22.437
If you could just give
me a moment, okay?

1123
01:53:42.593 --> 01:53:44.335
Hi, Sammy?

1124
01:53:50.628 --> 01:53:51.835
Oh!

1125
01:53:52.630 --> 01:53:54.335
