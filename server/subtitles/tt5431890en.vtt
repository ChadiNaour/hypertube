00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.827
<i>"you are charged
with an offence</i>

4
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.553

8
00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.005
"contrary to the said act."

9
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.744
How do you plead?

10
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.008
Guilty or not guilty?

11
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.392
- What?
- The neighbors will hear.

12
00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.869
Let's move over.

13
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.242
- Better?
- Better.

14
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.114
<i>And what about the situation
of persuading the people?</i>

15
00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.601
<i>Because it's very,
to put it mildly</i>

16
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.322
<i>uncomfortable to go to war
with 73% against.</i>

17
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.226
<i>If people are being asked today
do you support a war,</i>

18
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.324
<i>my answer to that
is we're not at war today.</i>

19
00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.629
<i>I think especially,
obviously, if the UN pass</i>

20
00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.514
<i>the second resolution,
as I believe they will</i>

21
00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.769
<i>if the inspectors carry on
saying he's not cooperating,</i>

22
00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.714
<i>I think public opinion
is in a different place.</i>

23
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.404
<i>When your correspondent
was saying</i>

24
00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.913
the war is inevitable,
war is not inevitable.

25
00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.846
It depends on Saddam.

26
00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.111
If he cooperates
with the inspectors,

27
00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.483
if he says
how much material he's got,

28
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.419
if he cooperates fully
with them,

29
00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:37.523
<i>then the issue's over.</i>

30
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.137
<i>But he's not doing that
at the moment.</i>

31
00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.820
Bloody liar.

32
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.861
They're all bloody liars.

33
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.473
You know, actually,
I don't think they are.

34
00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.008
I don't think the weapons
inspectors are lying.

35
00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.364
<i>This and international terrorism</i>

36
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.162
<i>are the two
big security threats.</i>

37
00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.930
- Want coffee?
- No, thanks.

38
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.031
<i>We were told,
we were given to understand</i>

39
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.295
that what these inspectors
were gonna come up with was

40
00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:01.007
evidence of weapons
of mass destruction,

41
00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.809
chemical,
biological and nuclear.

42
00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.681
What we know is that
he has this material.

43
00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:07.818
Oh, my God, we don't know that.
We don't know that.

44
00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:10.118
I mean, he just keeps
repeating the lie.

45
00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.522
You sure it's a lie?
Saddam's a psychopath.

46
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.903
Yeah, well, just because
you're the Prime Minister,

47
00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.804
it doesn't mean you get
to make up your own facts.

48
00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.694
<i>Do you think you have
the goods on him now?</i>

49
00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.042
<i>I've got no doubt at all that
he's developing these weapons</i>

50
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.159
<i>and that he poses a threat.</i>

51
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.225
- Be at the cafe by 4:00.
- I can fetch you at 5:00.

52
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.343
No, no, no. I was gonna
get the bus. I love you.

53
00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:39.451
Love you.

54
00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:52.598
Yes.

55
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.631
You know he has a place
in Devon.

56
00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.401
He wants to take me surfing
with his dog.

57
00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.369
- Is that a bad thing?
- No, it's a great dog.

58
00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.472
Okay.

59
00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.951
When was the last time
you got away?

60
00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.375
Don't know,
three or four weeks ago.

61
00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.843
We went hiking in Yorkshire.

62
00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.913
Shall we all go
hiking together?

63
00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.776
Yeah, that would be lovely.
With the dog?

64
00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.131
Thank you.

65
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.563
I'm starving.

66
00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.460
I've been here since 5:00,

67
00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.231
listening
to a Russian embassy staffer

68
00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.534
trying to bribe
a North Korean defector

69
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.303
who's been downloading
some kinky shit.

70
00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.378
- Very arousing few hours.
- You're disgusting.

71
00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:41.490
It's for the Queen and country.

72
00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:43.034
MI6 thought the Korean
was one of ours.

73
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.414
I just proved he's not.

74
00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.578
GCHQ, 1. MI6, 0.

75
00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:48.882
Katharine.

76
00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.948
I need your Beijing report
for the Foreign Office.

77
00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.720
They start trade talks
next week.

78
00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:53.825
Yeah, on it.

79
00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:21.847
Andy.

80
00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.812
Did you get this NSA e-mail?

81
00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.430
Are the Yanks really asking us
to dig up personal shit

82
00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:30.423
on UN Security Council
delegates?

83
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.356
"They want
the whole gamut of info

84
00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.587
"that could give
US policy makers an edge

85
00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.562
"in obtaining results
favorable to US goals."

86
00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.564
Christ, they wanna fix the vote.

87
00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.763
"This effort will probably peak
in the middle of next week

88

of State's presentation

"to the UN Security Council."

90
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.072
Powell's gonna argue for war.

91
00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.356
And they're gonna blackmail
the smaller nations

92
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.179
to make sure they get it. Fuck.

93
00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:59.548
Excuse me. Question.

94
00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:00.652
Yeah.

95
00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.718
This NSA memo,
our people approved it?

96
00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.592
Yes, that's why
it's been forwarded.

97
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.564
The Americans want us
to help them get a UN resolution for war?

98
00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.225
By next week?

99
00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.394
It's a joint UK/USA operation.

100
00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.964
UKUSA. Right. Got it.

101
00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.639
Hey, ours not to reason why.

102
00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.444
Everything good today,
Mrs. Archer?

103
00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.454
Yes, thank you.
Very good. Very, very good.

104
00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:36.920
I'll see you again tomorrow,
yes?

105
00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:38.023
Yes.

106
00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.954
Thank you, dear.

107
00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.923
- Hey.
- Hey.

108
00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.425
You okay?

109
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.661
Yeah, it's been a long day.

110
00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.831
I need ten minutes.
Want something to eat?

111
00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:55.974
No.

112
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.439
You working this weekend?

113
00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.410
Could we go somewhere,
get out of town?

114
00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.483
Sorry, <i>janum,</i>
I'll get next weekend for sure.

115
00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:06.586
<i>A question
for the President if I may.</i>

116
00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:10.487
<i>What is the status, in your
view, of any second resolution?</i>

117
00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:12.251
<i>Is it something
that you think is worth</i>

118
00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:16.193
<i>spending time and energy
trying to assemble?</i>

119
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.854
<i>Just let me reiterate
what I just said.</i>

120
00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.522
<i>This is a matter of weeks,
not months.</i>

121
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.970
<i>Any attempt to drag
the process on for months</i>

122
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.868
<i>will be resisted
by the United States.</i>

123
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.531
- Can we watch something else?
- No, no, this is important.

124
00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:32.270
<i>Secretary Powell
will make a strong case</i>

125
00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:35.542
<i>about the danger
of a armed Saddam Hussein</i>

126
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.480
and he will also talk
about Al-Qaeda links.

127
00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.280
Come on, there are
no credible links

128
00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:41.854
between Saddam and Al-Qaeda.

129
00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.650
<i>...really do portend
a danger...</i>

130
00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.300
- I'll turn it off.
- No, no, no, no, no.

131
00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.401
Please,
I need to watch this.

132
00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.536
I need to know
what they're saying.

133
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.791
I mean, yes.
Yes, Saddam is a dictator,

134
00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.364
but he is not a religious nut.

135
00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:53.796
I mean, why would he risk
arming Al-Qaeda

136
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.460
and have them turn against him?
It doesn't make any sense!

137
00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.562
Fine, but yelling at the TV
isn't going to make any difference.

138
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.799
They can't bloody hear you.

139
00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.134
- Where you going?
- To read a book.

140
00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:06.235
<i>You see, my vision
shifted dramatically</i>

141
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.870
<i>after September 11.</i>

142
00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:09.346
<i>I realized
the world has changed.</i>

143
00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:11.747
<i>My most important obligation
is to protect</i>

144
00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:13.978
<i>the American people
from further harm.</i>

145
00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.714
<i>And I will do that.</i>

146
00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.052
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

147
00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:29.398
- Love you.
- Love you.

148
00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.197
Don't forget to check in
at the station.

149
00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:33.538
What are you gonna do?

150
00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:36.037
I don't know. Read a book.

151
00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:38.843
I'll be back by 7:00 latest.

152
00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:57.128
- Mr. Gun. Signing in?
- Yes, thank you.

153
00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.365
When will you know
if you can stay?

154
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.768
They don't say.

155
00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.464
Could be weeks.
Could be months.

156
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.235
You never know with immigration,
do you?

157
00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.277
- I know.
- Thank you.

158
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.901
Hi, Jasmine, it's Kath.

159
00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.238
Are you around today?

160
00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:18.113
<i>I'd love to come and see you.</i>

161
00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.290
- Kath.
- Hi.

162
00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.086
Come here.

163
00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.293
Hello.

164
00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:32.295
Targeting who?

165
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.730
The UN Security Council.

166
00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.278
Particularly
the non-permanent members

167
00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.998
who could swing the vote
in favor of war.

168
00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.137
Jesus.

169
00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:43.772
Maybe it's time to quit.

170
00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:45.606
You know,
they say if you stay at GCHQ

171
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:48.180
for more than five years,
you never leave.

172
00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.907
I've still got two to go then.

173
00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.678
So you've still got
a conscience.

174
00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:55.950
Are you still organizing
against the war?

175
00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.620
Does GCHQ have a problem
with that?

176
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.494
- What? No.
- Give me your phone.

177
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.629
I've already
taken the battery out.

178
00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.763
- I called you from a payphone.
- Sorry.

179
00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:18.368
Go on.

180
00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.612
I just thought...

181
00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:29.214
...if I could get you
a copy of the memo,

182
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.950
then maybe you could get
somebody to look it over.

183
00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.287
I don't know, a journalist,

184
00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:35.224
someone
in the anti-war movement.

185
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.455
Look, if the press think
it's nothing, fine.

186
00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.191
At least my conscience is clear.

187
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.857
Your conscience?

188
00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:45.137
Kat, you're asking me
to collude in a breach

189
00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:48.230
of the Official Secrets Act.
Some call that treason.

190
00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:53.212
I am not trying to overthrow
my government.

191
00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:57.373
I just think
if someone in the press saw it,

192
00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:59.712
they might ask more questions
about what the Americans

193
00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.582
are asking
this country to do.

194
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.935
Hey, Kat, they're sending me
and Dan to London

195
00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.078
to learn Farsi.

196
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.008
Wow, Farsi. Congrats.

197
00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.210
- How many languages now?
- Eight.

198
00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:33.718
She's a freakin' super spy.

199
00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.845
Andy,
where's my Pyongyang report?

200
00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.787
- One more hour.
- Yeah, just get it done.

201
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.723
- When do you leave?
- Two weeks.

202
00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:42.419
You'll have to come visit me.

203
00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.705
Is that
the Foreign Office report?

204
00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.398
- It's a rough draft.
- Well, finish it.

205
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.974
Defense section
needs extra hands.

206
00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.875
I said I'd send you over there
this afternoon.

207
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.010
Okay, will do.

208
00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.721
<i>What we're giving you
our facts and conclusions</i>

209
00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.922
<i>based on solid intelligence.</i>

210
00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:03.563
<i>The issue before us
is not how much time</i>

211
00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:06.069
<i>we are willing to give
the inspectors,</i>

212
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:10.041
<i>but how much longer
are we willing to put up</i>

213
00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:14.944
<i>with Iraq's non-compliance
before we as a council,</i>

214
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.414
<i>we as United Nations say enough.</i>

215
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.574
<i>Enough.</i>

216
00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:23.379
<i>We have first-hand descriptions</i>

217
00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:27.859
<i>of biological weapons factories
on wheels and on rails.</i>

218
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.725
<i>The trucks and train cars
are easily moved</i>

219
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.389
<i>and are designed to evade
detection by inspectors.</i>

220
00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.359
<i>Although Iraq's
mobile production program</i>

221
00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.369
<i>began in mid-1990s,</i>

222
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.237
<i>UN inspectors at the time
only had vague hints</i>

223
00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.037
<i>of such programs.</i>

224
00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:47.375
<i>Confirmation came later
in the year 2000.</i>

225
00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:49.948
<i>The source was an eyewitness.</i>

226
00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.550
<i>An Iraqi chemical engineer</i>

227
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.619
<i>who supervised
one of these facilities.</i>

228
00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.752
Hi.

229
00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:56.712
Hi.

230
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.552
I'm gonna watch some football.
Do you mind?

231
00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:01.659
No. Go for it.

232
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.410
<i>From the north, the south,
the east and the west,</i>

233
00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.281
<i>from the left, the right</i>

234
00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.412
<i>from the radical
to the uncommitted</i>

235
00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:03.784
<i>they came.</i>

236
00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.853
<i>Well, we can argue forever
about the validity of opinion polls,</i>

237
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.293
<i>but what surely matters today</i>

238
00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:12.763
<i>is that this proposed war
by Britain</i>

239
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.699
<i>is historically unpopular</i>

240
00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:18.030
<i>and the mother of all
focus groups has descended.</i>

241
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.935
Hey, Martin. We're now doing
some real reporting.

242
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.339
It's huge.
Police are saying over 500,000.

243
00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:25.444
Organizers are saying
over two million.

244
00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:26.876
So it will be a million then?

245
00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.776
Well, it's everywhere.
Every country.

246
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.043
Biggest demonstration
in human history.

247
00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.812
Roger, I filed this story
seven times.

248
00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.718
And seven times I have told you
I'm not going to print it.

249
00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:38.221
Ed, this paper supports the war.

250
00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:39.985
Our sources support
the war, Kamal.

251
00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.357
All I'm asking is that
mine be given equal time.

252
00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:43.534
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

253
00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:44.688
Well, what do they say, Ed?

254
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.560
That intelligence
is being manipulated

255
00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:49.190
to support an invasion
that Bush Junior's been pushing for

256
00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.565
ever since Saddam tried to kill
his daddy in '93.

257
00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.365
Oh, come on,
your source is retired.

258
00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:55.064
My source is ex-CIA!

259
00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:56.675
He talks to agents every day

260
00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:58.368
and he's talking to me
on the record!

261
00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.537
Named source! Christ!

262
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.672
If you're gonna encourage
a country to go to war,

263
00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:05.760
perhaps you should spend
some time on the front lines yourself!

264
00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:08.310
- That is a cheap shot, Ed.
- Is it?

265
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.697
We're the press, for God's sake,

266
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.587
not a fucking PR agency
for Tony Blair.

267
00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.316
- That's enough!
- All right!

268
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.519
You, go back to the States.

269
00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:17.939
I want you to find me something
from a source

270
00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.591
who hasn't already retired

271
00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:21.393
and then maybe I'll rethink it.

272
00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.011
You're doing a great job of it.
We just need some more.

273
00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:25.664
Yes, Peter.
Fuck you very much.

274
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.000
And fewer words!

275
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.076
If I ask for 500,
don't send me 3,000!

276
00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:32.906
This paper needs to take
its finger out of its arse

277
00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:35.412
and stop taking
Tony Blair's press releases

278
00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:37.106
at face fucking value!

279
00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:38.945
- Hear, hear.
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

280
00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.575
- Christ!
- You're too bloody right.

281
00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:46.091
Brighty, where's my piece

282
00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:48.888
comparing Saddam to Milošević?
I need 400 words.

283
00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:51.293
Yeah. It's not really
a 400-word topic, Rog.

284
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.093
Yeah, it is. We have a right
to intervene in the Balkans.

285
00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:55.376
We should do the same in Iraq.

286
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.766
Iraq's a little
more complicated.

287
00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:59.303
- You've got Suni and Shia...
- Oh, fuck Sonny and Cher!

288
00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.407
What is this?
"I got you babe?"

289
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.121
Just give me 400 words
the average reader will understand.

290
00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.236
Milošević bad. Saddam bad.

291
00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:09.213
Just write a fucking story.
Stop overthinking it.

292
00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.314
All right.

293
00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:16.687
That was helpful.

294
00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.552
Just write the piece
as you see it, Martin,

295
00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:20.922
and we'll cut it down later
if we need to, all right?

296
00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.722
Okay. Thank you, Peter.

297
00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:28.227
Sonny and Cher.

298
00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:32.436
Martin Bright.

299
00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.666
<i>I've got something
you need to see.</i>

300
00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:37.332
<i>It's big, Martin, really big.</i>

301
00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.311
Yvonne?

302
00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:47.318
Yvonne?

303
00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:56.027
Martin. So good to see you.

304
00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:58.187
In an underground car park?

305
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.959
It's a little Deep Throat,
don't you think?

306
00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:02.830
- There's no signal down here.
- Right.

307
00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.199
Wait till you see this.

308
00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.848
- Who gave you this?
- Can't say.

309
00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.300
There's no info
saying who sent it.

310
00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:26.883
This could have been
written by anyone.

311
00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:30.654
- That's who wrote it.
- Well.

312
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.296
Frank Koza.

313
00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.364
- Who the fuck is Frank Koza?
- NSA.

314
00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.732
And this I know
because the letters NSA

315
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.863
have been written on the back
with a leaky ballpoint.

316
00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.839
My source says
the header wasn't printed

317
00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:46.343
to protect the recipients
at GCHQ.

318
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.580
When did you get it?

319
00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.047
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks?

320
00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:53.311
I gave it to <i>The Mirror</i> first.
Sorry.

321
00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.649
Jesus. Why didn't they run it?

322
00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.916
- They thought it was fake.
- No shit.

323
00:20:58.056 --> 00:21:00.992
- Is your source NSA?
- No. A friend of the recipient.

324
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.221
- A good friend.
- A friend of a friend?

325
00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:06.196
A good friend
of a trusted friend.

326
00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:07.527
I'm sure it's real.

327
00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:09.101
Then why don't you
write the story?

328
00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:10.827
Oh, come on, Martin.

329
00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.599
I'm anti-war.
You're with <i>The Observer.</i>

330
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.609
Just check it out.

331
00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.457
<i>NSA Press Office.
How may I assist you?</i>

332
00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:34.719
Yes, hi, hello there.

333
00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:37.261
This is Martin Bright
from <i>The Observer</i> in London.

334
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.203
I'd like to arrange
an interview

335
00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.927
with Mr. Frank Koza.

336
00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:43.297
May I speak to his office,
please?

337
00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:46.462
<i>- I'm sorry, Mr. Bright?</i>
- Martin Bright, yes.

338
00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:48.096
<i>Yes. Who did you wanna get?</i>

339
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.768
Frank Koza, "Chief of Staff,
Regional Targets."

340
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.606
<i>Mr. Bright, I'm afraid
we can't confirm</i>

341
00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.771
<i>the names of people
who work here.</i>

342
00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:57.292
<i>Could you give me
a little more detail</i>

343
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.909
<i>about the story
you're working on?</i>

344
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.211
Well, no. That's something
I need to talk to Mr. Koza

345
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.550
about directly, I'm afraid.

346
00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:08.320
<i>Well, then I'm afraid
I'm not sure I can help you.</i>

347
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.771
<i>When you have a little
more detail</i>

348
00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:12.128
<i>please feel free to call back.</i>

349
00:22:12.264 --> 00:22:13.288
Yeah, well...

350
00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.392
Hello?

351
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:19.130
- You rang the NSA Press Office?
- Yeah.

352
00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.271
They have a press office.

353
00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:21.949
I thought that was a good place
to start.

354
00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:23.251
But you didn't tell them
anything?

355
00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.403
No, Peter.
I just asked for Frank Koza.

356
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.088
Because if this is real,
you could go to jail

357
00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:29.843
just for having it
in your possession.

358
00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:31.759
I'm not letting this go.
It's too good a story.

359
00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.149
I agree,
but if you get it wrong

360
00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:35.413
it will sink you,
it will sink the paper.

361
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.352
I'd like to get
a credible intelligence expert

362
00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:39.287
to offer a view
on the language.

363
00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:41.071
- Yeah.
- And I thought you could run it by

364
00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.458
your MI6 contact?

365
00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.596
- I don't have a MI6 contact.
- Sorry.

366
00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.495
I meant your tennis club friend.

367
00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:49.834
Sure.

368
00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:51.630
I'll take it
to Admiral Wilkinson.

369
00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:55.469
Be careful. Before we risk
a D-notice against publication

370
00:22:55.574 --> 00:22:58.510
I'd actually like confirmation
that Frank Koza exists.

371
00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:00.545
Do you think it's authentic?

372
00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:02.204
Well, certainly the words he used,

373
00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:04.111
"TOPI," for example,

374
00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.844
few outside
of the security apparatus

375
00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:07.028
would know what that means.

376
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.111
What does it mean?

377
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.189
Target of primary interest.

378
00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:13.781
And this term,
"QRC surge effort,"

379
00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:15.451
that's NSA military speak

380
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.156
for significant intensification
of surveillance operations.

381
00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:22.132
And this, where they ask
for "valuable information

382
00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:25.466
"from accesses
in your product lines..."

383
00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:29.170
...product lines
are intelligence sources.

384
00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:32.335
So it's been written by someone
who's familiar with security speak

385
00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:34.379
but that doesn't mean
it's definitely NSA.

386
00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:36.846
True, but there are
no obvious amateur mistakes.

387
00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:39.383
- Have you heard of Frank Koza?
- No.

388
00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:45.412
Paul, if we, if we wanted
to confirm that he exists...

389
00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:47.583
Oh, sorry.
I couldn't help you do that.

390
00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:49.070
Yeah, but if we wanted
to confirm that he...

391
00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:51.529
Well, my own sources
wouldn't ever trust me again.

392
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:53.731
Understood.

393
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:56.434
Understood.

394
00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:01.737
- What?
<i>- Ed, Martin Bright.</i>

395
00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:04.069
Martin, Christ,
I just got back to DC.

396
00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:05.720
Sorry, Peter and I
have something urgent

397
00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:06.854
that we'd like to run by you.

398
00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:08.779
Are you on speaker?

399
00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:10.382
We are now. Hey...

400
00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:13.384
Peter, you need to tell Roger
to publish what I'm filing.

401
00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:16.387
This paper can't be seen
to be supporting a war

402
00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:18.065
that we should be doing
everything in our power

403
00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.250
to expose as a con.

404
00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:21.724
<i>A neocon.
A giant fucking con!</i>

405
00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:23.853
Ed, that's why we're phoning.
We need your help.

406
00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:26.124
We have something
that might corroborate

407
00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:27.699
these things, you could say.

408
00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:39.743
Hey. Sorry.

409
00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.590
- Do you wanna get lunch?
- What?

410
00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:44.310
Lunch. Eat. Now. Yes.

411
00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:46.281
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

412
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.288
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

413
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.753
It...

414
00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:53.257
This new BBC poll, it says that
less than one in ten people

415
00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:56.886
think it's right to attack Iraq
without a UN resolution.

416
00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:59.658
Which is why that memo was sent.
They need to twist arms.

417
00:24:59.798 --> 00:25:01.342
I don't think
it will make any difference.

418
00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:02.959
Most of the world
is against them.

419
00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:04.399
You wanna eat, eat.

420
00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:11.236
<i>National Security Agency.
How may I direct your call?</i>

421
00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.812
Hello, I'm returning
Frank Koza's call.

422
00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:15.436
My secretary said it was urgent.

423
00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:17.345
<i>I'm sorry.
Who are you trying to reach?</i>

424
00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:19.849
Frank Koza. Mr. Frank Koza.

425
00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.510
<i>Sir, I'm sorry,
there's no one</i>

426
00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.747
<i>by that name
in the directory, sir.</i>

427
00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:27.292
Oh, well, then that's odd.
He called me.

428
00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:30.658
<i>I'm sorry, but I'll need
an extension number.</i>

429
00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:32.864
<i>Do you have
an extension number?</i>

430
00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:35.332
Nah.

431
00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:38.632
<i>Is there anything else
I can do for you?</i>

432
00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.501
No. No.

433
00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:41.698
Thank you. Thank you.

434
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.138
<i>You have a nice day,
sir.</i>

435
00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:44.241
You too.

436
00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.305
Fuck off.

437
00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:50.678
So I read the weapons inspector's report.

438
00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:52.478
Congratulations.

439
00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:55.178
That's more
than most MP's ever done.

440
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.051
- Well, shit, that's depressing.
- It is.

441
00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:00.351
Look, there are a few
pre-98 chemical weapons

442
00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:02.403
we have yet to be accounted for
but inspectors said

443
00:26:02.427 --> 00:26:03.895
they found absolutely
no evidence

444
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:06.055
of an active chemical
or biological program.

445
00:26:06.197 --> 00:26:07.197
Correct.

446
00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:08.342
And yet Colin Powell presented

447
00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.028
clear evidence of mobile labs.

448
00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:13.332
His evidence may be based
on poor human intel

449
00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:14.872
from an Iraqi dissident.

450
00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.006
Really?

451
00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.184
The dissident isn't our product

452
00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:18.733
and should not be seen
as our product.

453
00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:21.913
Whose product is he then?

454
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:27.344
Look, Peter, I didn't say this,

455
00:26:27.452 --> 00:26:29.751
but there is concern
in certain quarters

456
00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:32.983
that intelligence
may be being manipulated

457
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:34.855
to take this country to war.

458
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.758
So why don't you tell
your journalists

459
00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:39.023
to stop being so bloody loyal
to Downing Street

460
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.758
and start doing their job?

461
00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:43.767
Okay.

462
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:50.708
Okay, what if I had evidence
that the NSA

463
00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:53.506
requested GCHQ to help monitor
private communications

464
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.911
of the UN Security Council
delegates?

465
00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:57.675
- To what end?
- Bluntly?

466
00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.910
To blackmail them
into voting for war.

467
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.451
I'm not with GCHQ.

468
00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:03.248
You're MI6,
you're on the same team.

469
00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.432
How did you hear about this?

470
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:06.357
A UN resolution for war

471
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.689
would cover everyone's arse,
wouldn't it?

472
00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:11.786
No more asking your team
to sex up evidence of WMDs

473
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.729
or the back-dodgy claims that
Britain was about to be attacked

474
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.768
by Iraq within 45 minutes.

475
00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:18.980
And no chance of anyone
being charged with a war crime

476
00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:20.632
if it all goes tits up.

477
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.640
What are you asking me, Peter?

478
00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:26.712
I'm asking if you can confirm

479
00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:30.475
whether the NSA instructed GCHQ

480
00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:33.414
to assist in spying
on Security Council delegates?

481
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.217
You know I can't answer that.

482
00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.757
To do so would put me in breach
of the Official Secrets Act.

483
00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:42.225
To deny it would not.

484
00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:47.959
Well, I can neither confirm
nor deny.

485
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.270
Okay.

486
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.565
Let's play.

487
00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.969
- Change ends, idiot.
- Yes.

488
00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:02.572
Your serve.

489
00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.583
So the head of the CIA
tells Bush it's a slam dunk

490
00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:08.518
that Saddam has weapons
of mass destruction.

491
00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:10.417
- A slam dunk.
- Yes.

492
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.616
- And that's not true?
- No.

493
00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:15.159
Meaning Saddam definitely
does not have weapons

494
00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:17.353
of mass destruction
or he may not.

495
00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:20.829
Meaning the intelligence
is sketchy at best

496
00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.524
and manufactured at worst.

497
00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.795
And Tenet knows that?

498
00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:27.429
I've no doubt he knows that.

499
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.872
I was with the agency 24 years.

500
00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:33.206
I can tell you, folks over there
are really angry about this.

501
00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:34.869
Why?

502
00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:36.447
Why?

503
00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.526
Because the majority
of the analysts do not believe

504
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.384
it's a slam dunk,
but no one wants to hear that.

505
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.221
Not even the press.

506
00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:46.881
- Sorry, Mel.
- I'm sorry.

507
00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:48.459
I'm just mad as hell.

508
00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.020
Listen, I wanted to talk
to you today

509
00:28:52.163 --> 00:28:55.895
because I think I might
finally be onto something that...

510
00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:59.732
...that really support what
you've been saying for months.

511
00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:02.170
I need to talk to a man
called Frank Koza.

512
00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:07.239
He's NSA.

513
00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:08.971
Head of Regional Targets.

514
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:12.642
You know him?

515
00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:16.888
I'm sorry, Ed.

516
00:29:17.021 --> 00:29:19.354
I can't give out
that kind of information.

517
00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:43.272
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

518
00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:44.725
- I didn't wanna call.
- How long have you been here?

519
00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.217
We're not supposed
to be meeting.

520
00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:48.377
I know, I've just...

521
00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:50.785
I've been following the news
and I haven't seen

522
00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:52.618
or heard anything
for three weeks.

523
00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:54.068
Okay, well,
I've given it to my contact

524
00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:55.856
and apparently,
she's having a very hard time

525
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.191
getting the papers
to believe that it's not a fake.

526
00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:05.531
Well, maybe that's okay.

527
00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:06.764
You know, I...

528
00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.082
Look, I mean,
all of the polls said

529
00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.426
everyone's against the war,
anyway

530
00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.602
and I,
and I've just been thinking...

531
00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:14.907
Look, I think
that I acted too rashly

532
00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.311
on impulse.
I didn't think...

533
00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:17.915
Jesus, Katharine, is it a fake?

534
00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.393
Of course it's not a fake.
It's real.

535
00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.885
Well, then just go home!

536
00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:24.046
Okay, don't talk about this
to anyone, ever!

537
00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:25.214
Just...

538
00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:29.917
- Sorry.
- It's out of our hands now.

539
00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.030
Sorry.

540
00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:38.259
The truth is, the whole document
could be a fake.

541
00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:40.929
But we're satisfied
the language used is real.

542
00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.564
- It's fascinating.
- Yeah.

543
00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:47.645
Is this document
actually in your possession?

544
00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:50.124
Well, if it were, I'd be
in breach of the Official Secrets Act

545
00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:51.309
wouldn't I?

546
00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:54.929
So based on what might be
in this document...

547
00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:56.664
- That you don't have.
- That I don't yet have.

548
00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.265
But that you want to print
in your paper.

549
00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:00.588
If you don't issue
a D-notice against publication.

550
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.036
Well, which I will
most certainly do

551
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.256
if I think the publication
might in any way

552
00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.126
endanger the lives
of British people

553
00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:07.859
or British forces.

554
00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:09.627
- Understood.
- Good.

555
00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:12.502
Go on.

556
00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:15.773
Would you say
it were likely real

557
00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:17.809
or a forgery?

558
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:20.037
What do you think?

559
00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:21.976
I think it could be a fake

560
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.276
put out
by the anti-war movement...

561
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:28.482
...or by a foreign agency
to embarrass the US.

562
00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:30.817
- Which agency?
- The Russians.

563
00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:33.276
I mean,
the French oppose the war, too,

564
00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:34.792
but I don't think
they'd do this.

565
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.362
I think you might be
overthinking it as usual, Martin.

566
00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:40.226
- Meaning?
- You tell me.

567
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.660
Well, meaning it could be
exactly what it says it is.

568
00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:50.371
You know, Martin,
I believe that all information

569
00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:53.808
collected in the name
of the public should be made public.

570
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.542
The only question is, when.

571
00:31:58.249 --> 00:32:01.913
But in this case, I don't have
the luxury of time, Admiral.

572
00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:04.249
Powell just made
a very strong case for war.

573
00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:06.384
Yes, I see.

574
00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:13.427
I have also always believed

575
00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:16.261
that censorship when called for

576
00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:20.338
should be based
on security issues alone...

577
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.201
...not on whether a news report
might embarrass a government.

578
00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:31.048
Thank you, Admiral.

579
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.449
<i>Ed, it's Edie
from the London office.</i>

580
00:32:35.586 --> 00:32:37.179
<i>I got a weird message for you</i>

581
00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:38.881
<i>from someone
who wouldn't give his name.</i>

582
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.586
<i>He said you should call
extension 6727.</i>

583
00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:45.424
<i>Makes no sense to me,
but maybe to you.</i>

584
00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:48.397
<i>6727. Good luck.</i>

585
00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:49.626
- 6727.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

586
00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:53.761
6727. 6727. 6727.

587
00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:01.111
6727.

588
00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:06.477
<i>NSA.
How may I direct your call?</i>

589
00:33:06.617 --> 00:33:10.076
Hello.
Extension 6727, please.

590
00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:11.816
<i>6727?</i>

591
00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.754
6727, yes.

592
00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:14.858
<i>One moment.</i>

593
00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:18.424
<i>Frank Koza's office.</i>

594
00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:22.627
Hello, may I speak
to Mr. Frank Koza, please?

595
00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:23.811
<i>Who shall I say is calling?</i>

596
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.134
I can't say.
Just put me through.

597
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.270
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

598
00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:30.601
<i>Hello?</i>

599
00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:35.003
Mr. Koza? Mr. Frank Koza?

600
00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:37.479
<i>Yes. Who's calling?</i>

601
00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:39.516
Mr. Koza,
my name is Ed Vulliamy.

602
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.279
I work for <i>The Observer</i>
newspaper in London.

603
00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:45.789
I wanted to ask you about a memo
you sent to GCHQ.

604
00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:50.922
Mr. Koza?

605
00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:58.097
- Do you think this is real?
<i>- Yes, they put me through.</i>

606
00:33:58.336 --> 00:33:59.964
- To Frank Koza?
- Yes.

607
00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:02.097
And you spoke to him directly,
right, Ed?

608
00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:04.766
<i>Well, we didn't exactly
have a conversation.</i>

609
00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:07.004
Did you speak to him or not?
Yes or no, Ed? Jesus.

610
00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.272
<i>Yes, but he cut me off</i>

611
00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.823
<i>when I said I worked
for</i> The Observer.

612
00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:12.476
But you're sure that he exists,
right, Ed?

613
00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:14.051
<i>Hell yes, I'm sure!</i>

614
00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:17.121
I said, "Mr. Koza?"
He said, "Yes, who's calling?"

615
00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:18.780
All right. Thank you, Ed.

616
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.984
Try not to fuck this one up,
Roger.

617
00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:22.822
- Fuck off.
<i>- You're welcome, anytime.</i>

618
00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.558
<i>- Hitler Diaries.</i>
- What?

619
00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:30.138
I'm just saying it smells of a forgery
like the <i>Hitler Diaries</i>

620
00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:32.012
and, of course, publishing those
cost people their jobs.

621
00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:33.504
Which is precisely
why we're doing

622
00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:35.971
rigorous checking on this,
Kamal.

623
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.134
- Who brought you this?
- Friend.

624
00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.143
- Someone from GCHQ?
- No.

625
00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:41.542
Then who?

626
00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.378
- Yvonne Ridley.
- Yvonne fucking Ridley!

627
00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.510
The woman who fell off a donkey
in Afghanistan

628
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.088
at some Taliban checkpoint!

629
00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.933
Her arse over a tit
with a camera up her burka

630
00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:54.197
and then she converted to Islam

631
00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:55.836
after she was released
by her kidnapper.

632
00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.260
None of which means
she's not right!

633
00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:58.522
She's anti-war!

634
00:34:58.629 --> 00:35:01.155
She probably typed
the fucking thing herself.

635
00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:04.099
Martin, you realize
the legal risks we'll be taking?

636
00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:05.995
The last time
we published anything like this

637
00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:07.528
you and Roger
almost went to prison.

638
00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:09.231
Jan, the last time
our source claimed

639
00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:11.899
MI6 had funded an attempted
assassination on Gaddafi.

640
00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:13.511
This document
doesn't accuse anyone

641
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.409
of doing anything
remotely like that.

642
00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:19.005
No, it merely suggests
that the US government,

643
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:22.451
with the help of Great Britain,
might try to twist arms

644
00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:25.523
and threaten UN delegates
into voting for a war in Iraq.

645
00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:27.524
It's a hell of a story.

646
00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:33.458
Look, we know Koza exists.

647
00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:35.726
Beaver says
the language used is authentic.

648
00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.461
And Wilkinson says
that while publication

649
00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:38.842
may embarrass both governments,

650
00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.647
he doesn't believe
that it poses a security risk

651
00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:42.697
to the British people
or the armed forces.

652
00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:43.951
Ironically,
publication may actually

653
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.807
prevent a war and save lives.

654
00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:48.139
- Well.
- MI6?

655
00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:51.249
Would not confirm
but did not deny.

656
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:54.810
Jan, where are we legally?

657
00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:56.716
Wilkinson may not issue
a D-Notice

658
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.222
but that doesn't stop
Special Branch from coming after us.

659
00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:02.225
- Thank you.
- Legally, we have a top secret document

660
00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:03.385
in our possession.

661
00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:09.229
Look, Rog, don't forget

662
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:10.801
we're getting
detailed information

663
00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:12.767
directly from Blair's office.

664
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.566
- Fuck off.
- Well, he's right.

665
00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:17.335
Printing this kind of story
would kill that relationship.

666
00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.910
Since when did this paper
prioritize political access

667
00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.912
over its own
investigative reporting?

668
00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.346
- Yes.
- We have taken a position on this, guys!

669
00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:25.973
We support the war.

670
00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:30.120
Yes. We do.

671
00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:32.815
Fuck.

672
00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:34.823
But Peter's right.

673
00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.761
This is a fucking good story.

674
00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:50.006
Thank you, Roger.

675
00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:54.878
Here we go.

676
00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:08.853
Wait, I'll come with you.

677
00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.237
I'm just going to go
get some milk.

678
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.638
Go back to bed.
I'll bring you a coffee.

679
00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:12.662
Okay.

680
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:26.806
- Hi.
- Morning.

681
00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:44.854
Hey.

682
00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:53.901
What's the matter, <i>janum?</i>

683
00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.410
What's going on?

684
00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:10.248
- Bravo, Martin.
- There he is.

685
00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:11.515
Well done.

686
00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:16.421
- Here he is!
- Nice one, Martin.

687
00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:26.595
Brighty, congratulations.

688
00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:28.228
Bloody brilliant.

689
00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.137
- Thank you.
- What have you got for me next?

690
00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:32.209
Every major European paper
is citing us

691
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.643
and we've had calls
in from CNN, NBC, and Fox.

692
00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.423
They all want to interview you
for their morning shows

693
00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:37.813
when they wake up in the US.

694
00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.159
Any response
from Downing Street?

695
00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:41.584
We got a call in,
but they're scrambling.

696
00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:46.647
Martin, line 2.

697
00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.450
Martin Bright.

698
00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:53.054
Thank you. Thank you.

699
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:54.924
No.

700
00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:57.331
No, the person who leaked it
hasn't been identified.

701
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.340
Why'd you do it?

702
00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:04.135
I just thought
that they'd investigate.

703
00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:06.019
I never expected them
to print the whole memo.

704
00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:07.306
Why didn't you tell me?

705
00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:09.914
Sorry, I didn't,
I didn't, I...

706
00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:12.659
I thought that you would try
and talk me out of it

707
00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:13.683
and I didn't want you to.

708
00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.252
- My God, <i>janum.</i>
- I'm so sorry.

709
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:16.514
They don't mention your name?

710
00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:21.853
- I haven't told anyone.
- Good. That's good.

711
00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.494
That's very kind.
All right, thank you.

712
00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:31.469
Why don't you get in touch
with your friend Tony, Kamal?

713
00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:33.769
- Ask him if he has an opinion.
- That's not funny, Rog.

714
00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:34.965
- Martin?
- Yes?

715
00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:37.007
NBC just canceled
your interview.

716
00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:38.165
What?

717
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.439
NBC no longer wished
to interview Martin.

718
00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:43.878
Did they say why?

719
00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:46.526
They just said sorry,
but they didn't think

720
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.984
they could fit you in anymore.

721
00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.144
Really?

722
00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:51.950
Brighty, reporter from Santiago.

723
00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:54.320
Thank you. Martin Bright.

724
00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:57.656
No.

725
00:39:57.762 --> 00:39:59.602
At this stage, we have no idea
what information

726
00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.041
was gathered from Chile
or any of the other countries.

727
00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.294
- Peter.
- Yeah?

728
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.528
Fox says
that they have to cancel.

729
00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:05.795
What? Why?

730
00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.372
Yeah,
Mexico is furious too.

731
00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.804
Okay. Thank you.

732
00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:11.136
- Martin?
- Yes?

733
00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.870
I've got a producer from CNN.

734
00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.279
Martin Bright.

735
00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:20.049
I see.

736
00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:24.248
No. No, no. No, no.
That's all right.

737
00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:27.717
May I ask why?

738
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.495
Yes, I stand by it.
Of course I stand by it.

739
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.757
<i>The Drudge Report?</i>

740
00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.268
Yeah.

741
00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:40.932
All right, okay.

742
00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:43.199
What the fuck is going on?

743
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.119
It's fake.

744
00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:02.920
We've printed
a fake fucking memo

745
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.029
from Yvonne fucking Ridley!

746
00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:13.397
You fucking idiot.
There. You see it?

747
00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:14.972
Because the Americans did.

748
00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:18.098
Favourable. F-A-V-O-U-R.

749
00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:22.976
Some English cunt has tried
to fake an American NSA memo

750
00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:25.309
and you fucking schmucks
fell for it.

751
00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.441
Wait.
Martin, where's the original?

752
00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:29.796
Where's the original document?

753
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.913
Jesus.

754
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.432
- American spelling.
- What?

755
00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:45.969
The original
has American spelling.

756
00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:50.274
And this is what I filed, see?

757
00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:52.070
Favorable. O-R.

758
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.735
Just like the original.
Not O-U-R.

759
00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:56.575
And recognize with a Z,
not an S.

760
00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:03.082
Who changed what I wrote?

761
00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:07.920
Who...

762
00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.169
Who changed
what I fucking wrote?

763
00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:11.128
Come on, speak up!
Who did this?

764
00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.037
Nicole, what did you do?

765
00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.308
I...

766
00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.044
I ran it through spell check.

767
00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.715
- Spell check?
- Jesus.

768
00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:43.692
That's what I always do.
I'm so sorry.

769
00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:45.386
Do not cry, Nicole.

770
00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.828
Do not fucking cry.

771
00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:55.004
Okay, well, we know
that it's not fake.

772
00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:57.684
We go online, we explain what happened,
we call all of the networks.

773
00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.040
Stop it, Martin.

774
00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.645
Fuck, Rog,
it was an honest mistake.

775
00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:03.839
Don't be so naive.

776
00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:07.146
You're an American editor.
What story do you put out now?

777
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:10.050
That <i>The Observer</i>
is doubling down on a fake memo?

778
00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.881
Or that the staff
of this newspaper

779
00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:16.255
are really so colossally stupid!

780
00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.706
It's all right.
Would you like a cup of tea?

781
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.623
Someone in this building

782
00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:59.965
has betrayed their government
and their country.

783
00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.869
Now I'm sure it wasn't anyone
in this division,

784
00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:04.601
but starting today,

785
00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:07.712
Internal Security
will be conducting interviews

786
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.144
with each and every one of you.

787
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:14.074
If you know anything
or suspect anyone,

788
00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:17.712
it is your sworn duty
to speak up.

789
00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:20.290
If you do not
and you are found to have

790
00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:22.552
withheld information
of any kind,

791
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.152
you will be charged
with a breach

792
00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:27.890
of the Official Secrets Act.

793
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.507
You should see the file
that tosser's got on me.

794
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.141
- What did he ask you?
- Katharine!

795
00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:33.395
Come in, Katharine.

796
00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.159
- Katharine Gun?
- Yes?

797
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.465
I'm John from Internal Security.
Please.

798
00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:57.683
Mandarin translator.

799
00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:01.358
GCHQ for two years.

800
00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.825
- Yes.
- And before that?

801
00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:06.089
I taught English
to Japanese students.

802
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.892
- Hiroshima, right?
- Yes.

803
00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.660
Interesting.

804
00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:13.602
Did you visit the memorial?

805
00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:14.830
The peace memorial?

806
00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:16.930
To the people
killed by the atomic bomb?

807
00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.535
Yes, actually, I did.

808
00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:21.668
It's...

809
00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:24.557
It's something
you really have to see.

810
00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:25.776
It's very moving.

811
00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:31.422
Compels one to think
about the consequences of war,

812
00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:32.750
doesn't it?

813
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:37.052
- Yes, I suppose it does.
- Are you anti-war, Katharine?

814
00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.459
No.

815
00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:41.565
I think
sometimes war is necessary.

816
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.762
I see you lived in Taiwan
as a child?

817
00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:51.034
- Yes.
- How long did you live there?

818
00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:52.803
We moved over
when I was three.

819
00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:55.139
I came back
to do my A-levels.

820
00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:56.456
So for most
of your childhood then?

821
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.480
Yes.

822
00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:00.484
You had a religious upbringing?

823
00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:01.778
No, not particularly.

824
00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:02.919
But were you sent away

825
00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.978
to a Christian missionary school
in Taiwan?

826
00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:06.122
Yes.

827
00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:08.248
Gave you a clear sense
of right and wrong, did it,

828
00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:09.553
being in a mission school?

829
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.900
I think
my parents gave me that.

830
00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:13.189
Did you leak the Koza e-mail?

831
00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.761
- No.
- No?

832
00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:16.866
No.

833
00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.637
- But you read it?
- Yes.

834
00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:23.104
I mean, it was sent to me,
so I read it.

835
00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:25.733
What were your immediate
thoughts after you read it?

836
00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:28.488
Nothing much.
It didn't really bother me.

837
00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:30.640
- It didn't?
- No.

838
00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:35.414
Who do you think
might have leaked it?

839
00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.921
- I have no idea.
- No?

840
00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.789
- No.
- No?

841
00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:44.894
No.

842
00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.326
Thank you, Mrs. Gun.

843
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.162
<i>That's all for now.</i>

844
00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.608
Eat a little.

845
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:01.711
Please.

846
00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:07.484
They're bringing everyone in.
One by one.

847
00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:12.518
You haven't said anything?

848
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.653
Okay. Just eat a little.

849
00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:21.159
Everything will be all right.

850
00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:26.869
Eat.

851
00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.980
Hi, Fiona, it's Katharine.

852
00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:39.582
I'm so sorry

853
00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:42.312
but I don't think I'm gonna
be able to come in today.

854
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:45.014
Yeah, I think
I've caught a tummy bug.

855
00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.057
Yeah.

856
00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.917
Thank you.

857
00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.189
Thank you so much.

858
00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:54.763
What'd she say?

859
00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:57.424
She said
I should get some rest.

860
00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:59.058
Good.

861
00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:01.034
- She was nice.
- That's good.

862
00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:04.666
Try and sleep.

863
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:09.607
Sorry, I have to go.

864
00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:24.958
<i>...ask you about a report
in</i> The Observer <i>newspaper</i>

865
00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:26.928
<i>in London, a memo</i>

866
00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:30.597
<i>reported to be from a man
who actually works at the NSA</i>

867
00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:34.535
<i>in which he describes
a "surge in surveillance</i>

868
00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:37.198
<i>"of UN Security Council
members."</i>

869
00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:38.366
<i>What's your response?</i>

870
00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:41.035
Terry, as a matter
of long-standing policy

871
00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:43.375
the administration
never comments on anything

872
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.814
involving any people
involved in intelligence.

873
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.442
- No, of course, you don't.
- What the fuck?

874
00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:51.555
<i>If you're
a Cameroonian diplomat</i>

875
00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:54.090
<i>or a French diplomat
at the United Nations</i>

876
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.668
<i>then you're gonna have
to operate on the assumption</i>

877
00:49:55.692 --> 00:49:56.903
<i>that the United States
is bugging you.</i>

878
00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:59.328
<i>No, it's a blanket matter
of policy</i>

879
00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:02.058
<i>that we do not answer questions
of that nature...</i>

880
00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.724
- Hi.
- Hi.

881
00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.945
<i>...I'm not indicating to you
whether it's true or not true.</i>

882
00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.335
Have you eaten?

883
00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:10.930
<i>...of policy that predates
this administration.</i>

884
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:14.068
I brought soup. A bean salad.

885
00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:16.677
I'm gonna say it was me.

886
00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:20.950
The Americans are refusing
to admit that the memo was real.

887
00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:23.282
- I have to tell the truth.
- No.

888
00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:26.357
If I don't, then they'll get away
with saying it was a fake.

889
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.483
<i>Janum,</i> you did what you could.
Now leave it alone, please!

890
00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:30.626
What am I supposed to do?

891
00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.253
Am I supposed to keep lying
forever?

892
00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.140
If you say nothing,
they can never prove anything.

893
00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.860
They are questioning
everyone at work.

894
00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.176
They're interrogating
my friends.

895
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.759
They're asking people
to name names.

896
00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:41.964
- That will be over soon.
- And then what?

897
00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:43.506
There will be a question mark

898
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.768
in hundreds of people's files
because of me.

899
00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.141
They will put you in jail!

900
00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:49.543
I have to prove it was real.

901
00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:50.806
Everyone at work knows that

902
00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.849
what the NSA asked us to do
was illegal.

903
00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:54.781
- Nobody cares!
- Well, I care!

904
00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.020
If I don't say it was me,
then we'll go to war

905
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:01.321
based on blackmail
and lies.

906
00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:03.326
And I can't live
with that. I won't.

907
00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:07.325
<i>Janum,</i> please listen to me.

908
00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:09.858
I work at a cafe.

909
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.491
I took the job
because I needed a job.

910
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.536
But it's just a job.

911
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.969
You did the same thing,
remember?

912
00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:17.917
When you saw the advert,
you said you didn't even know

913
00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:19.569
what the job really was.

914
00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:23.236
It's just a job.

915
00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:26.009
And you can get another job.

916
00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.764
You just need to keep your head
down for a few more weeks

917
00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:33.086
until things calm down.

918
00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:36.660
Then you resign,
you can get another job.

919
00:51:54.406 --> 00:51:55.430
Hey.

920
00:52:03.715 --> 00:52:05.445
On a diet?

921
00:52:05.584 --> 00:52:07.553
- What?
- No cinnamon bun?

922
00:52:10.288 --> 00:52:11.551
Who's in there now?

923
00:52:12.624 --> 00:52:14.752
Nuri. Second time.

924
00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.452
Had him take a lie detector test
yesterday.

925
00:52:22.501 --> 00:52:23.501
<i>Mi-Yung!</i>

926
00:53:22.494 --> 00:53:23.655
I did it.

927
00:53:26.131 --> 00:53:27.429
It was me.

928
00:53:31.536 --> 00:53:32.663
Katharine.

929
00:53:37.809 --> 00:53:38.936
Leave us, please.

930
00:54:33.365 --> 00:54:34.492
Handbag.

931
00:54:37.135 --> 00:54:38.135
Rings.

932
00:54:40.872 --> 00:54:42.101
Necklace.

933
00:54:43.575 --> 00:54:45.601
Watch. Belt.

934
00:54:46.278 --> 00:54:47.439
I don't have a belt.

935
00:54:50.882 --> 00:54:52.510
Take her through cell 7.

936
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.560
I've found the passports
and a couple of foreign books.

937
00:55:14.005 --> 00:55:15.268
Who are you?

938
00:55:17.175 --> 00:55:18.438
Where's my wife?

939
00:55:21.179 --> 00:55:23.478
I want to see her.
Where is she?

940
00:55:23.615 --> 00:55:26.710
They can't keep me long.
They haven't charged me yet.

941
00:55:26.818 --> 00:55:28.309
No contact, please.

942
00:55:32.457 --> 00:55:35.120
- Where are they holding you?
- Downstairs.

943
00:55:37.295 --> 00:55:39.389
I'm okay.
I promise I'm okay.

944
00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.467
I brought this.

945
00:55:51.843 --> 00:55:53.471
It will get cold tonight.

946
00:55:58.116 --> 00:55:59.116
Thank you.

947
00:56:14.833 --> 00:56:16.096
Lights out.

948
00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:30.708
- Katharine Gun?
- Yes.

949
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:33.785
We're from Scotland Yard.
Do you have a lawyer?

950
00:56:34.919 --> 00:56:35.943
No.

951
00:56:36.054 --> 00:56:38.148
There's a duty solicitor on call.

952
00:56:38.256 --> 00:56:39.622
She'll sit in with you.

953
00:56:44.362 --> 00:56:47.389
Your supervisor speaks highly
of your integrity.

954
00:56:47.532 --> 00:56:51.560
She says this breach
was a foolish one-off.

955
00:56:51.703 --> 00:56:52.864
Was it?

956
00:56:53.004 --> 00:56:55.633
Do you mean if I leaked anything else? No.

957
00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:57.538
- Do you intend to?
- No.

958
00:56:59.277 --> 00:57:01.508
I've always been very proud
to work at GCHQ.

959
00:57:01.613 --> 00:57:02.613
Until now.

960
00:57:04.115 --> 00:57:06.346
Yes. Until now.

961
00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:08.147
What were you employed to do?

962
00:57:09.754 --> 00:57:11.382
Well, I can't be specific.

963
00:57:12.957 --> 00:57:14.084
Be general then.

964
00:57:15.427 --> 00:57:17.225
I translated signals intelligence

965
00:57:17.362 --> 00:57:18.830
and I reported anything

966
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:20.762
I thought might be of interest
to my clients.

967
00:57:20.899 --> 00:57:22.663
- Your clients?
- The Foreign Office.

968
00:57:22.767 --> 00:57:23.894
The Ministry of Defense.

969
00:57:24.035 --> 00:57:25.936
So, you work for the British Government.

970
00:57:26.071 --> 00:57:28.768
- No. Not really.
- No?

971
00:57:28.907 --> 00:57:30.671
Governments change.

972
00:57:30.775 --> 00:57:32.573
I work for the British people.

973
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.235
I gather intelligence

974
00:57:34.379 --> 00:57:38.373
so that the government
can protect the British people.

975
00:57:38.483 --> 00:57:41.453
I do not gather intelligence
so that the government can lie

976
00:57:41.586 --> 00:57:43.214
to the British people.

977
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:48.416
With respect, Mrs. Gun,

978
00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.085
you're a spy.

979
00:57:50.895 --> 00:57:51.895
Yes.

980
00:57:51.963 --> 00:57:52.963
You gather information

981
00:57:53.064 --> 00:57:54.623
from people's phones and computers

982
00:57:54.766 --> 00:57:56.632
and you feed that to your clients.

983
00:57:56.768 --> 00:58:00.466
- Yes.
- You eavesdrop on private conversations.

984
00:58:00.572 --> 00:58:01.938
- Yes.
- And now you're upset

985
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.385
at being asked to do that
to members of the Security Council?

986
00:58:04.409 --> 00:58:06.139
Detective...

987
00:58:06.277 --> 00:58:10.237
I don't object to being asked
to collect information

988
00:58:10.348 --> 00:58:13.443
that could help prevent a terror attack.

989
00:58:13.585 --> 00:58:17.579
What I object to is being asked
to gather intelligence

990
00:58:17.689 --> 00:58:20.716
to help fix a vote at the UN

991
00:58:20.825 --> 00:58:23.590
and deceive the world into going to war.

992
00:58:27.365 --> 00:58:30.062
- Who put you up to this?
- No one.

993
00:58:30.168 --> 00:58:31.602
But you gave the memo to someone.

994
00:58:31.703 --> 00:58:34.138
Who did you give it to? A journalist?

995
00:58:34.272 --> 00:58:36.832
Someone in the anti-war movement?

996
00:58:36.975 --> 00:58:37.999
Your husband?

997
00:58:39.444 --> 00:58:40.488
You don't have to answer that.

998
00:58:40.512 --> 00:58:41.512
No, I will answer that.

999
00:58:41.613 --> 00:58:43.809
My husband had absolutely
nothing to do with this.

1000
00:58:43.948 --> 00:58:46.440
He was briefly detained
here, too, wasn't he?

1001
00:58:46.551 --> 00:58:49.350
- Pending deportation?
- Yes, he was.

1002
00:58:49.487 --> 00:58:52.286
- And then you married him.
- Yes.

1003
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:54.256
His paperwork has been resubmitted.

1004
00:58:54.359 --> 00:58:56.351
- He signs in here once a week.
- He's a Muslim.

1005
00:58:58.396 --> 00:58:59.396
I'm sorry?

1006
00:58:59.497 --> 00:59:01.295
He's a Kurdish Turk

1007
00:59:01.399 --> 00:59:04.369
seeking permanent residence in Britain.

1008
00:59:04.502 --> 00:59:07.995
And given what Saddam Hussein
has done to the Kurdish people,

1009
00:59:08.139 --> 00:59:12.042
murdering over 180,000 of them
with chemical weapons,

1010
00:59:12.177 --> 00:59:13.611
I can assure you

1011
00:59:13.711 --> 00:59:16.510
my husband has absolutely
no sympathy whatsoever

1012
00:59:16.648 --> 00:59:17.672
with the Iraqi regime.

1013
00:59:17.815 --> 00:59:19.010
Then why did you leak a memo

1014
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.052
intended to help remove Saddam Hussein?

1015
00:59:22.187 --> 00:59:23.450
'Cause by attacking Iraq,

1016
00:59:23.555 --> 00:59:26.024
you don't simply attack Saddam Hussein,

1017
00:59:26.157 --> 00:59:29.321
you attack the country
of over 30 million people!

1018
00:59:29.427 --> 00:59:31.794
And I cannot bear to think
of the pain and the suffering

1019
00:59:31.896 --> 00:59:33.023
that that will cause.

1020
00:59:33.164 --> 00:59:36.396
Frankly, I don't see
how anyone can bear it.

1021
00:59:36.534 --> 00:59:39.129
Detective, is she going to be
formally charged?

1022
00:59:39.237 --> 00:59:41.138
That's a decision
for the Attorney General.

1023
00:59:41.239 --> 00:59:45.301
Lord Goldsmith will need time
to decide how to deal with you.

1024
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:47.538
The custody sergeant will release you

1025
00:59:47.679 --> 00:59:49.147
on police bail today.

1026
00:59:49.247 --> 00:59:51.011
You'll be told to return to the station

1027
00:59:51.115 --> 00:59:53.016
in approximately three months,

1028
00:59:53.117 --> 00:59:55.245
by which time a decision
on whether to charge you

1029
00:59:55.386 --> 00:59:56.820
will have been made.

1030
01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:09.265
Are you all right, <i>janum?</i>

1031
01:00:10.535 --> 01:00:12.504
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, come on.

1032
01:00:12.604 --> 01:00:14.505
Katharine?

1033
01:00:14.606 --> 01:00:17.405
I'm sorry. I deal mostly
with petty criminals,

1034
01:00:17.542 --> 01:00:19.738
drunks and drug addicts.

1035
01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.869
If you're charged,
you're gonna need someone

1036
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.108
with a lot more experience than me.

1037
01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:26.377
- I see.
- Have you heard of Liberty?

1038
01:00:27.218 --> 01:00:28.880
They handle human rights cases,

1039
01:00:28.987 --> 01:00:32.389
political cases, often for free.

1040
01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:36.291
Well... I just wanted
to be sure you knew that.

1041
01:00:37.228 --> 01:00:38.423
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1042
01:00:38.563 --> 01:00:39.563
Thank you.

1043
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.661
<i>George W. Bush's patience with
the United Nation has run out</i>

1044
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.467

<i>what they call, a moral majority.</i>

1047

<i>That represents a real failure

1050

<i>The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith</i>

1051

<i>has, I understand, told the Prime Minister</i>

1052
01:01:05.156 --> 01:01:08.388
<i>military action would be legal

01:01:08.493 --> 01:01:10.052
<i>But it's all down to interpretation.</i>

1054
01:01:10.161 --> 01:01:11.839
What is she saying?
They have not got the votes

1055
01:01:11.863 --> 01:01:13.832

<i>...arguing old UN resolutions don't count</i>

1057

- Do you wanna come in?
- No, no, no.

I'm all packed for London.

1068
01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:42.084
I just...

1069
01:01:42.894 --> 01:01:45.454
I just wanted to say,
I think that what you did was amazing.

1070
01:01:47.231 --> 01:01:50.633
- You do?
- Yeah. A lot of us do.

1071
01:01:51.903 --> 01:01:52.903
Really?

1072
01:01:54.505 --> 01:01:56.303
Are they going to charge you?

1073
01:01:57.842 --> 01:01:58.842
I don't know.

1074
01:02:02.046 --> 01:02:04.140
God, Kat, I'm so sorry.

1075
01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:05.807
Hey, you didn't do anything wrong.

1076
01:02:05.917 --> 01:02:08.853
I didn't do anything right either.

1077
01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:20.555
I better be going. Bye.

1107
01:04:32.964 --> 01:04:34.592
We have nothing to hide.

1108
01:04:38.002 --> 01:04:39.868
You should contact those lawyers...

1109
01:04:42.173 --> 01:04:43.173
...today.

1110
01:04:44.408 --> 01:04:45.408
Please.

1111
01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:13.531
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. It's Katharine.

1112
01:05:13.671 --> 01:05:15.082
Katharine Gun. I phoned this morning.

1113
01:05:15.106 --> 01:05:18.167
<i>Yes, Katharine. Please, come on up.</i>

1114
01:05:25.216 --> 01:05:27.082
- Katharine?
- Hello.

1115
01:05:27.218 --> 01:05:29.312
James. Lovely to meet you.

1116
01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.013
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Not at all.

1117
01:05:31.122 --> 01:05:32.556
I'm sorry about the decor.

1118
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:35.421
We like to say
we focus more on our clients.

1119
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.654
This is Shami Chakrabarti, our director.

1120
01:05:37.762 --> 01:05:41.529
- Hello, Katharine.
- And this is Ben Emmerson.

1121
01:05:41.632 --> 01:05:43.828
- Hi.
- Hello.

1122
01:05:43.935 --> 01:05:46.234
This was the only memo you took?

1123
01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:48.839
- Yes.
- No one suggested you take it?

1124
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.603
- No.
- And you've never met Martin Bright?

1125
01:05:51.742 --> 01:05:53.608
- No.
- Martin called me last week.

1126
01:05:53.744 --> 01:05:55.372
He said he didn't know who you were,

1127
01:05:55.479 --> 01:05:58.608
but he wanted us to be aware
that you might need our help.

1128
01:05:58.749 --> 01:06:00.775
Well, that was very kind of him.

1129
01:06:00.918 --> 01:06:03.046
He said he got the memo
from someone he knew

1130
01:06:03.154 --> 01:06:05.020
but he wouldn't say who.

1131
01:06:05.122 --> 01:06:07.887
Do you want to tell us who you gave it to?

1132
01:06:10.962 --> 01:06:12.954
Look,

1133
01:06:13.097 --> 01:06:16.761
if you don't mind,
I would prefer not to say.

1134
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:18.369
I promised I wouldn't.

1135
01:06:19.136 --> 01:06:20.136
Okay.

1136
01:06:21.305 --> 01:06:24.104
When you met Yasar, he had
already applied for asylum.

1137
01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:26.540
- Yes.
- Which was denied.

1138
01:06:26.644 --> 01:06:30.240
Yes, they said that there
wasn't a significant enough risk

1139
01:06:30.348 --> 01:06:32.214
of persecution if he went back.

1140
01:06:32.316 --> 01:06:33.807
And that's when you married him?

1141
01:06:33.951 --> 01:06:35.943
- Yes.
- And did he pay you?

1142
01:06:36.087 --> 01:06:37.214
Absolutely not.

1143
01:06:37.321 --> 01:06:38.465
I'm sorry, I don't mean to upset you.

1144
01:06:38.489 --> 01:06:40.151
It's just that your husband is Muslim

1145
01:06:40.291 --> 01:06:42.131
and the prosecution
will be looking for motive.

1146
01:06:42.259 --> 01:06:45.388
My motive was to stop a war

1147
01:06:45.496 --> 01:06:48.625
and save lives. I failed.

1148
01:06:50.034 --> 01:06:52.629
All I've managed to do is put
my husband's future at risk.

1149
01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:54.602
And your own.

1150
01:06:54.705 --> 01:06:56.173
In fact, by leaking information

1151
01:06:56.307 --> 01:06:57.900
to try and stop a war, I'd argue

1152
01:06:58.009 --> 01:07:00.342
that you chose loyalty to your country

1153
01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:04.472
over loyalty to your government,
your marriage and yourself.

1154
01:07:04.615 --> 01:07:07.141
You had nothing to gain
and everything to lose.

1155
01:07:08.953 --> 01:07:11.115
I think that speaks rather highly of you.

1156
01:07:12.356 --> 01:07:15.190
He's trying to give you a compliment.

1157
01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:16.326
I see.

1158
01:07:16.394 --> 01:07:18.488
Part of our job is to try and anticipate

1159
01:07:18.629 --> 01:07:21.758
what the prosecution's
going to throw at you.

1160
01:07:21.866 --> 01:07:24.495
Some of the people we meet
are looking for attention,

1161
01:07:24.635 --> 01:07:26.866
a way to elevate their humdrum lives.

1162
01:07:27.004 --> 01:07:29.496
- Well, I'm not.
- No, I don't think you are.

1163
01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:34.504
Sorry.

1164
01:07:34.645 --> 01:07:36.614
There's nothing to be sorry for.

1165
01:07:36.714 --> 01:07:38.478
We're here to help.

1166
01:07:41.552 --> 01:07:43.180
And we don't have duress.

1167
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.722
She's adamant no outside agency
put any pressure on her.

1168
01:07:46.857 --> 01:07:48.655
Public interest?

1169
01:07:48.759 --> 01:07:51.138
The public has a right to know
when their government is lying.

1170
01:07:51.162 --> 01:07:52.994
We cite the Falklands case

1171
01:07:53.097 --> 01:07:54.827
when Thatcher lied about why she ordered

1172
01:07:54.932 --> 01:07:56.412
the sinking of that Argentinian ship.

1173
01:07:56.534 --> 01:07:57.797
<i>- Belgrano.</i>
- Yeah.

1174
01:07:57.902 --> 01:08:00.167
- Who was the whistleblower?
- Clive Ponting.

1175
01:08:00.271 --> 01:08:01.648
The jury acquitted him, didn't they?

1176
01:08:01.672 --> 01:08:02.849
Yes, and immediately afterwards,

1177
01:08:02.873 --> 01:08:04.842
Thatcher had
the Official Secrets Act amended

1178
01:08:04.942 --> 01:08:06.702
to avoid being caught in a lie
in the future.

1179
01:08:06.744 --> 01:08:08.975
So since '89, the public interest is

1180
01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.675
effectively whatever
the government says that it is.

1181
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:14.480
We've got nothing.

1182
01:08:14.585 --> 01:08:16.349
I have to think about it.

1183
01:08:16.454 --> 01:08:18.719
Sorry, I have to go.

1184
01:08:18.856 --> 01:08:20.825
I promised Anne a weekend away.

1185
01:08:22.526 --> 01:08:25.018
If they charge her,
we might have to plead guilty

1186
01:08:25.129 --> 01:08:26.654
and ask for a reduced sentence.

1187
01:08:26.764 --> 01:08:28.995
But she's young and principled.

1188
01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.501
A judge might even think that
what she did was morally right.

1189
01:08:31.602 --> 01:08:33.833
Or crucify her as a traitor.

1190
01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:36.940
Bye.

1191
01:09:04.635 --> 01:09:07.537
- You sure he was following you?
- He was staring at me.

1192
01:09:07.638 --> 01:09:08.638
Sometimes men stare...

1193
01:09:08.739 --> 01:09:09.816
Yeah, it wasn't that kind of a stare.

1194
01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.069
What kind of a stare was it?

1195
01:09:11.175 --> 01:09:14.202
Yas, please, I'm scared. Okay?

1196
01:09:14.311 --> 01:09:15.438
I'm scared.

1197
01:09:17.414 --> 01:09:19.645
You know, for years,
I've tried to be legal here.

1198
01:09:19.784 --> 01:09:21.116
- I know.
- Then why'd you do it?

1199
01:09:21.252 --> 01:09:23.414
These arseholes got their war, anyway.

1200
01:09:23.521 --> 01:09:25.217
Saddam's over. And you know what?

1201
01:09:25.322 --> 01:09:27.382
- I'm glad he's over!
- War is not over.

1202
01:09:27.491 --> 01:09:29.050
Ousting Saddam is just the beginning.

1203
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.629
- What do you know about war?
- I work at GCHQ.

1204
01:09:31.762 --> 01:09:33.822
All you do is listen to people talking!

1205
01:09:33.964 --> 01:09:36.559
You've never seen war!
You've never smelled it!

1206
01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:37.794
Never even come close to it!

1207
01:09:37.935 --> 01:09:39.961
Yas, I understand why you are angry.

1208
01:09:40.104 --> 01:09:42.266
It is my fault and I'm sorry.

1209
01:09:42.373 --> 01:09:44.137
I am so sorry.

1210
01:09:44.275 --> 01:09:49.111
But I watched Blair with his smug smile

1211
01:09:49.213 --> 01:09:52.081
and his sterile speeches
that tell us nothing

1212
01:09:52.183 --> 01:09:56.120
of what it must feel like
to be a child in Iraq right now.

1213
01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:58.416
I know I'm not sorry
that I tried to stop him.

1214
01:09:58.522 --> 01:09:59.649
I'm not.

1215
01:10:00.858 --> 01:10:02.827
I'm only sorry that I failed.

1216
01:10:10.968 --> 01:10:13.836
Thank you for inviting us in.

1217
01:10:13.971 --> 01:10:15.166
What is it you came to say?

1218
01:10:15.306 --> 01:10:19.141
Well, there's been a development.

1219
01:10:19.243 --> 01:10:21.712
- Am I going to be charged?
- That I don't know.

1220
01:10:21.846 --> 01:10:23.337
Then why are you here?

1221
01:10:25.015 --> 01:10:27.177
I gather you went to see a lawyer today.

1222
01:10:27.318 --> 01:10:28.616
- Did you follow me?
- No.

1223
01:10:28.719 --> 01:10:29.778
Because somebody did.

1224
01:10:29.887 --> 01:10:31.565
Well, you must know
that after what you did,

1225
01:10:31.589 --> 01:10:33.285
GCHQ is concerned.

1226
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:35.985
I have a right to legal advice.

1227
01:10:36.093 --> 01:10:39.860
Unfortunately, it's not as simple as that.

1228
01:10:39.997 --> 01:10:42.557
When you signed on to work for GCHQ,

1229
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.568
you agreed to be bound
by the Official Secrets Act

1230
01:10:45.703 --> 01:10:47.695
for the rest of your life.

1231
01:10:47.838 --> 01:10:50.501
I know what I signed, detective.

1232
01:10:50.608 --> 01:10:54.340
Then you know that it says here

1233
01:10:54.445 --> 01:10:56.380
in Section 1-1

1234
01:10:56.947 --> 01:10:59.314
that "a person is guilty of an offense

1235
01:10:59.416 --> 01:11:02.716
"if he or she

1236
01:11:02.853 --> 01:11:04.845
"discloses any information

1237
01:11:04.955 --> 01:11:07.652
"relating to security or intelligence."

1238
01:11:08.726 --> 01:11:12.163
This means that you cannot
discuss anything

1239
01:11:12.263 --> 01:11:15.165
with anyone outside of GCHQ

1240
01:11:15.266 --> 01:11:17.735
relating to the document you leaked.

1241
01:11:19.603 --> 01:11:21.834
Are you saying I can't talk to a lawyer?

1242
01:11:21.939 --> 01:11:23.874
You have the right to talk to a lawyer.

1243
01:11:23.974 --> 01:11:25.772
It's just that you cannot discuss

1244
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:29.005
anything to do with your work at GCHQ,

1245
01:11:29.313 --> 01:11:31.179
or the contents of the memo you leaked,

1246
01:11:31.282 --> 01:11:33.410
or how it came into your possession

1247
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:35.018
or who wrote it.

1248
01:11:36.387 --> 01:11:39.414
All of this information is top secret.

1249
01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:42.549
So disclosing it
to anyone outside of GCHQ,

1250
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.720
even a lawyer,

1251
01:11:44.828 --> 01:11:48.458
would be a further violation
of the Official Secrets Act,

1252
01:11:48.599 --> 01:11:51.865
which could result in further prosecution

1253
01:11:51.969 --> 01:11:54.803
and a much longer prison sentence.

1254
01:11:57.808 --> 01:12:00.277
We just wanted you to be aware of that.

1255
01:12:02.613 --> 01:12:06.641
So if I may not talk to a lawyer,
who may I talk to?

1256
01:12:06.784 --> 01:12:09.379
You should talk to your superiors at GCHQ.

1257
01:12:09.486 --> 01:12:12.081
- Are you fucking joking?
- Yas, please. Please.

1258
01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:15.750
We should hear
what the detectives have to say.

1259
01:12:15.859 --> 01:12:17.657
They're just doing their job.

1260
01:12:20.798 --> 01:12:25.736
Simply put, if you wish
to tell anything to a lawyer

1261
01:12:25.836 --> 01:12:28.396
or the press or anyone else...

1262
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.508
...you first need to clear it with GCHQ.

1263
01:12:36.347 --> 01:12:37.508
Detective...

1264
01:12:38.849 --> 01:12:41.683
I leaked only one memo.

1265
01:12:41.819 --> 01:12:43.117
I had good reason to do so

1266
01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.247
and I intend to make those reasons public

1267
01:12:46.357 --> 01:12:48.519
if I am charged.

1268
01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.858
I will not talk to my lawyers again

1269
01:12:51.996 --> 01:12:54.295
unless I am charged.

1270
01:12:55.799 --> 01:12:57.825
Tell that to GCHQ.

1271
01:13:03.807 --> 01:13:05.327
Are you grilling or smoking that fish?

1272
01:13:05.409 --> 01:13:08.174
I am smoking.
I've soaked the wood chips in water.

1273
01:13:08.312 --> 01:13:09.312
I've got charcoal.

1274
01:13:09.413 --> 01:13:12.281
I'm... I'm trying something new.

1275
01:13:12.383 --> 01:13:14.852
- Hi.
- Ken?

1276
01:13:14.985 --> 01:13:16.647
- Hi.
- Hi, Ken.

1277
01:13:16.754 --> 01:13:19.434
- Guess you're down here for the weekend.
- Yes. Just for the night.

1278
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:21.015
Yeah, me too. It's been a while.

1279
01:13:21.358 --> 01:13:23.054
Would you... Do you want a drink?

1280
01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.289
No, thanks. Sally's cooking dinner.

1281
01:13:26.397 --> 01:13:28.832
- Hello, Anne.
- Hi.

1282
01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:31.902
- I'm so sorry to intrude.
- Not at all.

1283
01:13:32.036 --> 01:13:33.299
How's the new job?

1284
01:13:34.004 --> 01:13:36.701
Well, it's eye-opening.

1285
01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:41.676
In fact, I wondered
if I might ask Ben's opinion

1286
01:13:41.779 --> 01:13:45.181
about a new case that my office
has been asked to prosecute.

1287
01:13:45.282 --> 01:13:48.480
It won't take a minute. Would you mind?

1288
01:13:48.585 --> 01:13:50.486
How do you know that I met her?

1289
01:13:50.587 --> 01:13:53.182
Security services are all over this.

1290
01:13:54.591 --> 01:13:56.355
And it's not just
a domestic embarrassment.

1291
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.826
The Americans are very unhappy.

1292
01:13:57.928 --> 01:13:59.191
Well, that is upsetting.

1293
01:13:59.296 --> 01:14:01.424
Come on, Ben, it's not funny.

1294
01:14:02.633 --> 01:14:05.569
What she did was
a deliberate act of betrayal.

1295
01:14:05.702 --> 01:14:07.933
Look, Ken, we're not colleagues anymore.

1296
01:14:08.072 --> 01:14:09.404
We're on different sides here.

1297
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.840
I think she wants to be seen
as some sort of cause celebre.

1298
01:14:14.078 --> 01:14:18.209
But she swore allegiance
to the intelligence services

1299
01:14:18.315 --> 01:14:20.395
and when you do that
you don't get to pick and choose

1300
01:14:20.484 --> 01:14:21.747
what orders you'll follow.

1301
01:14:21.885 --> 01:14:24.218
Following orders
is not a defense to a war crime.

1302
01:14:24.321 --> 01:14:28.520
Yes, but who is she to undermine
the strategic objectives

1303
01:14:28.625 --> 01:14:31.459
of a democratically-elected
Prime Minister.

1304
01:14:31.595 --> 01:14:34.463
Come on, she's not selling
state secrets to Moscow.

1305
01:14:34.598 --> 01:14:36.794
She exposed an illegal attempt

1306
01:14:36.934 --> 01:14:39.233
to secure a UN resolution for war

1307
01:14:39.336 --> 01:14:41.016
which would have given Blair perfect cover

1308
01:14:41.071 --> 01:14:42.482
for the bloody mess that we're in now.

1309
01:14:42.506 --> 01:14:44.600
No, she should have kept her mouth shut

1310
01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.903
or complained to her superiors.

1311
01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:48.455
Now I've got a real problem with people

1312
01:14:48.479 --> 01:14:50.471
who think that from some lowly position

1313
01:14:50.614 --> 01:14:52.310
they can possibly see the big picture.

1314
01:14:52.449 --> 01:14:54.129
So then you would never question authority

1315
01:14:54.184 --> 01:14:55.824
even if you knew it was breaking the law.

1316
01:14:55.919 --> 01:14:58.650
Ben, you can't blame me
for being angry with her.

1317
01:14:58.789 --> 01:14:59.789
We're at war.

1318
01:14:59.857 --> 01:15:02.383
So, I'm going to assign
the best prosecutor in my office

1319
01:15:02.493 --> 01:15:04.724
to bring this girl down,
which shouldn't be difficult.

1320
01:15:04.828 --> 01:15:05.828
She's already confessed.

1321
01:15:05.929 --> 01:15:07.727
I appreciate your determination

1322
01:15:07.831 --> 01:15:11.063
to make an example of her,
but you shouldn't be here.

1323
01:15:13.704 --> 01:15:15.172
Come on, we're friends.

1324
01:15:15.305 --> 01:15:17.331
I'll make my position perfectly clear.

1325
01:15:17.474 --> 01:15:19.636
If you charge her, then I will defend her

1326
01:15:19.776 --> 01:15:21.745
to the best of my ability.

1327
01:15:24.014 --> 01:15:25.175
So let's go home and pretend

1328
01:15:25.315 --> 01:15:27.443
that this conversation never happened.

1329
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:03.116
You're not working today?

1330
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.281
No. I have to sign in at the station.

1331
01:16:08.892 --> 01:16:12.329
- Then we can go for a hike.
- I want to see the sea.

1332
01:16:25.742 --> 01:16:26.801
Leave it.

1333
01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:36.045
<i>Hi, we're not in. Please leave a message.</i>

1334
01:16:36.186 --> 01:16:39.588
<i>Katharine, it's James Welch from Liberty.</i>

1335
01:16:39.723 --> 01:16:41.555
<i>We should talk.</i>

1336
01:16:41.692 --> 01:16:44.491
<i>Could give me a call
when you get the message?</i>

1337
01:16:44.595 --> 01:16:45.654
Hello?

1338
01:16:46.763 --> 01:16:48.026
<i>Katharine.</i>

1339
01:16:49.132 --> 01:16:52.000
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

1340
01:16:52.102 --> 01:16:54.230
James, you know that

1341
01:16:54.371 --> 01:16:56.237
GCHQ said I couldn't talk to you.

1342
01:16:56.373 --> 01:16:57.705
<i>Then, well, the good news is</i>

1343
01:16:57.808 --> 01:17:00.039
<i>we finally had the gag order lifted.</i>

1344
01:17:00.143 --> 01:17:01.621
<i>We've agreed to not ask any questions</i>

1345
01:17:01.645 --> 01:17:04.444
<i>about what other work you did at GCHQ.</i>

1346
01:17:04.581 --> 01:17:07.745
<i>But what happens
going forward isn't up to them.</i>

1347
01:17:09.253 --> 01:17:10.413
<i>Your case is now in the hands</i>

1348
01:17:10.487 --> 01:17:12.752
<i>of the Crown Prosecution Service.</i>

1349
01:17:15.626 --> 01:17:17.424
<i>They're going to charge you.</i>

1350
01:17:20.831 --> 01:17:22.629
<i>We should meet next week.</i>

1351
01:17:25.936 --> 01:17:27.302
<i>- Katharine?</i>
- Yes.

1352
01:17:29.239 --> 01:17:30.867
Okay. Yeah.

1353
01:17:32.276 --> 01:17:34.438
<i>I know that this is a lot to take in,</i>

1354
01:17:34.578 --> 01:17:35.739
<i>but we will help you.</i>

1355
01:17:35.846 --> 01:17:37.109
Thank you.

1356
01:17:39.349 --> 01:17:40.817
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Thank you very much, James.

1357
01:17:40.951 --> 01:17:41.951
<i>Speak soon.</i>

1358
01:17:47.324 --> 01:17:50.055
"GCHQ whistleblower charged."

1359
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.492
"Traitor or spy?"

1360
01:17:51.628 --> 01:17:52.994
"Spy speaks out."

1361
01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:54.826
"The spy who wouldn't keep a secret."

1362
01:17:54.965 --> 01:17:57.264
"Who is Katharine Gun?"

1363
01:17:57.367 --> 01:17:59.097
"Leak against this war."

1364
01:18:00.137 --> 01:18:01.969
She's everywhere.

1365
01:18:02.105 --> 01:18:03.937
What's your angle?

1366
01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:05.100
Look.

1367
01:18:06.677 --> 01:18:08.475
"Katharine Gun faces jail for exposing

1368

01:18:12.983 --> 01:18:15.316
"it is Bush and Blair

1371
01:18:15.452 --> 01:18:17.318
Celebrity supporters?

1372
01:18:17.454 --> 01:18:19.286
Little tabloidy, don't you think?

1373
01:18:19.389 --> 01:18:22.120
Hey, we're building awareness.
How about Daniel Ellsberg?

1374
01:18:22.225 --> 01:18:23.955
He leaked the Pentagon Papers.

1375
01:18:24.061 --> 01:18:25.495
I know who Ellsberg is, Martin.

1376
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:27.188
Of course you do. Forgive me.

1377
01:18:27.331 --> 01:18:30.665
Well, Ellsberg described it as...

1378
01:18:30.801 --> 01:18:33.168
"The most important
and courageous leak I've ever seen.

1379
01:18:33.303 --> 01:18:34.814
"No one else has ever done what she did.

1382
01:18:41.044 --> 01:18:43.878
Okay, that's classy.

1383
01:18:50.554 --> 01:18:51.681
I'll be quick.

1384
01:19:17.681 --> 01:19:19.206
Are you waiting for the tall man?

1385
01:19:19.349 --> 01:19:21.079
- The dark-haired one?
- Yeah.

1386
01:19:21.218 --> 01:19:23.346
He was shouting
that his wife was outside.

1387
01:19:23.453 --> 01:19:24.978
- They took him.
- What?

1388
01:19:25.088 --> 01:19:26.088
They took him.

1389
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.300
Where is he?

1390
01:19:38.402 --> 01:19:39.927
Sorry. Who are you?

1391
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:41.868
I'm Yasar Gun's wife. Where's my husband?

1392
01:19:41.972 --> 01:19:45.500
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He's scheduled for deportation.

1393
01:19:46.109 --> 01:19:47.109
What?

1394
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.838
No. No, no. No, no.

1395
01:19:48.945 --> 01:19:51.176
Look, look, there's been
some sort of mistake.

1396
01:19:51.281 --> 01:19:53.113
I need to see my husband right now.

1397
01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:54.946
I'm afraid that's not possible.

1398
01:19:56.119 --> 01:19:57.678
You can't go in there!

1399
01:19:57.788 --> 01:19:59.586
Please. Please, please, please, please.

1400
01:19:59.723 --> 01:20:01.055
Let me see him, please.

1401
01:20:01.158 --> 01:20:02.402
Please, he doesn't have anything with him.

1402
01:20:02.426 --> 01:20:03.689
He doesn't even have any money.

1403
01:20:03.794 --> 01:20:06.628
I'm sorry. They've already taken him.

1404
01:20:06.763 --> 01:20:08.732
<i>No, no.
They won't say where.</i>

1405
01:20:08.832 --> 01:20:10.943
I don't know. Oh, God, James,
I don't know what to do.

1406
01:20:10.967 --> 01:20:13.368
<i>Katharine, I'm so sorry. I'm at the Hague.</i>

1407
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:15.098
<i>- Who's your MP?</i>
- I don't know.

1408
01:20:15.238 --> 01:20:17.038
<i>- Is it Nigel Jones?</i>
- Nigel Jones, yes. Yeah.

1409
01:20:17.107 --> 01:20:18.384
<i>Do you have your marriage certificate?</i>

1410
01:20:18.408 --> 01:20:19.706
- Yeah, yeah, somewhere.
<i>- Right.</i>

1411
01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:22.370
<i>Find it and I'll track Nigel down.</i>

1412
01:20:22.479 --> 01:20:23.790
Of course they're
legally married, Beverly.

1413
01:20:23.814 --> 01:20:25.544
I'm holding their marriage certificate.

1414
01:20:25.649 --> 01:20:26.759
<i>I'm sorry, but his application</i>

1415
01:20:26.783 --> 01:20:28.581
<i>to remain in this country has been denied.</i>

1416
01:20:28.685 --> 01:20:29.709
Mistakenly.

1417
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.311
He's complied with every directive

1418
01:20:31.455 --> 01:20:32.455
your department's issued.

1419
01:20:32.589 --> 01:20:34.387
<i>Nigel, your constituent is accused</i>

1420
01:20:34.491 --> 01:20:35.754
<i>of betraying her country.</i>

1421
01:20:35.859 --> 01:20:37.987
<i>Do you really think we should
be helping her husband?</i>

1422
01:20:38.128 --> 01:20:40.495
I think deporting her husband
when she's facing a trial

1423
01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:42.963
looks like state bullying.

1424
01:20:46.336 --> 01:20:48.828
<i>All right, I'll review his paperwork.</i>

1425
01:20:48.972 --> 01:20:50.304
Thank you.

1426
01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.636
And please make sure
he's not flown out tonight.

1427
01:20:55.479 --> 01:20:57.948
I'm sorry. Best I can do for now.

1428
01:20:58.048 --> 01:21:00.916
I promise I will pick this up
first thing tomorrow.

1429
01:21:01.718 --> 01:21:02.718
Hello?

1430
01:21:02.819 --> 01:21:05.152
<i>We tracked him to
Harmondsworth Detention Center.</i>

1431
01:21:05.288 --> 01:21:07.450
<i>It's a deportation center
at Heathrow Airport</i>

1432
01:21:07.557 --> 01:21:09.458
<i>right off the M-25.</i>

1433
01:21:09.559 --> 01:21:11.357
<i>Go to the main gate and wait there.</i>

1434
01:21:11.495 --> 01:21:12.827
<i>Are they gonna release him?</i>

1435
01:21:12.963 --> 01:21:15.262
<i>We have ministerial approval
but no paperwork yet.</i>

1436
01:21:15.365 --> 01:21:16.799
<i>There is a possibility</i>

1437
01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:19.028
<i>he's already been put on a plane.</i>

1438
01:21:19.169 --> 01:21:20.501
- What?
<i>- Yeah, I'm checking.</i>

1439
01:21:20.637 --> 01:21:22.105
<i>Just get there as soon as you can.</i>

1440
01:21:22.205 --> 01:21:25.141
Out you go. Let's go. Move it.

1441
01:21:28.211 --> 01:21:30.339
This is a mistake, sir.

1442
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.210
- This is a mistake.
- Come on.

1443
01:21:33.717 --> 01:21:34.878
Please.

1444
01:21:35.986 --> 01:21:38.512
I need to call my wife.
I must call my wife!

1445
01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:05.881
<i>Next in line.</i>

1446
01:22:29.539 --> 01:22:30.539
Hello?

1447
01:22:35.745 --> 01:22:36.769
Hello?

1448
01:22:44.921 --> 01:22:45.921
Yeah?

1449
01:22:47.057 --> 01:22:48.685
James, James,

1450
01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:50.954
I don't know
if I'm even at the right place.

1451
01:22:51.094 --> 01:22:53.029
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
but it's 4:00 a.m.

1452
01:22:53.129 --> 01:22:55.598
There's nobody to talk to.

1453
01:22:55.732 --> 01:22:58.099
Wait, wait. Someone's coming. Wait.

1454
01:22:59.936 --> 01:23:01.268
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1455
01:23:03.607 --> 01:23:05.303
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1456
01:23:05.442 --> 01:23:06.562
- It's all right.
- You okay?

1457
01:23:06.643 --> 01:23:07.683
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

1458
01:23:07.744 --> 01:23:09.110
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1459
01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.097
If they try and pull
anything like that again,

1460
01:23:18.121 --> 01:23:19.121
then I want to go public.

1461
01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:20.780
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

1462
01:23:20.924 --> 01:23:23.052
Because people are fickle.
Many will hate you.

1463
01:23:23.159 --> 01:23:24.821
Your personal lives will be picked apart,

1464
01:23:24.961 --> 01:23:26.589
your marriage will be interrogated.

1465
01:23:26.696 --> 01:23:28.426
In fact, we think it will be best

1466
01:23:28.531 --> 01:23:31.330
if Yasar was kept well out of this.

1467
01:23:31.468 --> 01:23:33.801
You should probably not attend the trial.

1468
01:23:35.372 --> 01:23:38.069
- I understand.
- What? No.

1469
01:23:38.174 --> 01:23:40.268
<i>Janum,</i> we both know the jury will prefer

1470
01:23:40.377 --> 01:23:42.021
an English girl
without an immigrant husband.

1471
01:23:42.045 --> 01:23:43.356
You know what? That is ridiculous.

1472
01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:45.645
We are married and we have
nothing to be ashamed of.

1473
01:23:45.782 --> 01:23:47.614
The shame is on them, not you.

1474
01:23:47.717 --> 01:23:50.687
You don't need to risk
your freedom to prove it.

1475
01:23:51.621 --> 01:23:54.250
We should discuss how you'll plead.

1476
01:23:54.357 --> 01:23:55.484
Not guilty.

1477
01:23:55.625 --> 01:23:57.617
But you understand you confessed.

1478
01:23:57.727 --> 01:24:01.186
I confessed that I leaked a memo
in order to try and save lives.

1479
01:24:01.331 --> 01:24:05.701
And we will use that argument
to ask for a reduced sentence.

1480
01:24:05.835 --> 01:24:08.669
If you do plead guilty,
there will be no jury.

1481
01:24:08.805 --> 01:24:10.865
You could be out of jail
in less than six months.

1482
01:24:11.007 --> 01:24:12.669
Given how badly the war is going,

1483
01:24:12.809 --> 01:24:14.937
we think a judge is likely
to be sympathetic.

1484
01:24:15.045 --> 01:24:17.344
But I'd have a criminal record.

1485
01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.480
That is true.

1486
01:24:18.548 --> 01:24:21.313
Which I would carry with me
for the rest of my life

1487
01:24:21.418 --> 01:24:22.818
into every job interview,

1488
01:24:22.919 --> 01:24:24.079
every application for credit.

1489
01:24:24.154 --> 01:24:25.884
- Yes.
- And I'm sorry.

1490
01:24:26.022 --> 01:24:28.821
We would be conceding

1491
01:24:28.925 --> 01:24:31.895
that no one in Intelligence
can ever tell the British people

1492
01:24:32.028 --> 01:24:33.792
when their government is lying.

1493
01:24:33.897 --> 01:24:35.137
Not when the lies are protected

1494
01:24:35.231 --> 01:24:37.564
by the Official Secrets Act, no.

1495
01:24:37.701 --> 01:24:38.744
I'm sorry. This is all a charade.

1496
01:24:38.768 --> 01:24:40.808
I mean, if you're saying
that I have to plead guilty

1497
01:24:40.904 --> 01:24:43.499
because the act allows
absolutely no defense whatsoever,

1498
01:24:43.606 --> 01:24:45.734
then the very idea
of a fair trial is a joke.

1499
01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:47.673
I'm sorry, Katharine,

1500
01:24:47.777 --> 01:24:51.680
but the best we can do
is ask a judge for leniency.

1501
01:24:51.781 --> 01:24:54.376
Post <i>Belgrano,</i> there really is no defense

1502
01:24:54.517 --> 01:24:55.895
to a breach of the Official Secrets Act...

1503
01:24:55.919 --> 01:24:57.751
Except perhaps one.

1504
01:24:58.755 --> 01:25:00.417
Katharine said it herself.

1505
01:25:00.557 --> 01:25:03.049
She leaked the memo to try to save lives.

1506
01:25:03.193 --> 01:25:04.491
But she still broke the law.

1507
01:25:04.594 --> 01:25:06.995
Yes, but there are circumstances
where you can break the law.

1508
01:25:07.097 --> 01:25:09.726
It's only in situations
of absolute necessity...

1509
01:25:09.866 --> 01:25:12.335
- Necessity. Exactly.
- Ben, you're reaching.

1510
01:25:12.435 --> 01:25:15.428
Am I? What are the requirements
for a defense of necessity?

1511
01:25:15.572 --> 01:25:17.583
Imminent threat to your life
or the lives of others.

1512
01:25:17.607 --> 01:25:20.008
Yeah, and no other reasonable
way to prevent loss of life.

1513
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:21.703
Yes, right, well, the invasion posed

1514
01:25:21.811 --> 01:25:23.837
an imminent threat to thousands of lives.

1515
01:25:23.947 --> 01:25:25.787
Katharine has no right
to try and prevent a war

1516
01:25:25.882 --> 01:25:27.126
authorized by the Attorney General.

1517
01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:30.552
- Unless the war is illegal.
- What?

1518
01:25:30.653 --> 01:25:32.952
Wait, wait, so now we're going
to put the war on trial?

1519
01:25:33.089 --> 01:25:34.682
Yes.

1520
01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:39.126
I believe that Katharine Gun
tried to stop an illegal war.

1521
01:25:39.262 --> 01:25:41.026
What she did was necessary

1522
01:25:41.131 --> 01:25:44.226
to try to save thousands
of British-American and Iraqi lives.

1523
01:25:44.334 --> 01:25:47.361
And Goldsmith specifically stated

1524
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:48.961
that the invasion was legal.

1525
01:25:49.105 --> 01:25:51.802
He said so only three days
before the invasion.

1526
01:25:51.941 --> 01:25:53.301
What was his position before that?

1527
01:25:53.409 --> 01:25:56.038
What was his advice at the time
Katharine leaked the memo?

1528
01:25:56.146 --> 01:25:57.957
- Well, we have no idea.
- Well, I'd like to find out.

1529
01:25:57.981 --> 01:25:59.415
Because Blair spent a lot of energy

1530
01:25:59.516 --> 01:26:01.917
trying to secure a new UN resolution.

1531
01:26:02.018 --> 01:26:03.213
I suppose.

1532
01:26:03.319 --> 01:26:05.413
When Lord Goldsmith finally said

1533
01:26:05.522 --> 01:26:09.118
the war was legal,
his deputy legal advisor resigned.

1534
01:26:09.259 --> 01:26:10.970
Yes, Elizabeth Wilmshurst.
Yeah, that's right.

1535
01:26:10.994 --> 01:26:12.404
- She resigned. Yes, yes.
- But she didn't say why.

1536
01:26:12.428 --> 01:26:13.794
She couldn't.

1537
01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:16.008
If she did, she'd be charged
under the Official Secrets Act.

1538
01:26:16.032 --> 01:26:18.160
So I need to get a meeting
with Elizabeth Wilmshurst.

1539
01:26:18.301 --> 01:26:19.979
- She's not gonna go public.
- She doesn't have to.

1540
01:26:20.003 --> 01:26:21.301
All we need is a hint

1541
01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:24.236
that Goldsmith changed his mind
about the legality of the war.

1542
01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:28.141
I'm sorry, Ben.
There are two ways they could justify war.

1543
01:26:28.278 --> 01:26:30.278
- We've only addressed one.
- So what am I missing?

1544
01:26:30.346 --> 01:26:31.814
- Self-defense.
- Come on.

1545
01:26:31.948 --> 01:26:33.748
Does anyone honestly believe
that this country

1546
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:35.443
was about to be attacked by Iraq?

1547
01:26:35.552 --> 01:26:37.817
I do agree, but that's why
they trotted out Powell.

1548
01:26:37.954 --> 01:26:40.116
To make the case for WMDs.

1549
01:26:40.223 --> 01:26:41.967
If it's true that Iraq
has weapons of mass destruction

1550
01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:44.426
that pose an imminent threat
to this country,

1551
01:26:44.527 --> 01:26:48.362
the war is legal without a UN resolution.

1552
01:26:48.498 --> 01:26:49.796
How many people actually believe

1553
01:26:49.899 --> 01:26:51.663
Iraq still has weapons
of mass destruction?

1554
01:26:51.801 --> 01:26:53.167
Well, they're still looking.

1555
01:26:53.303 --> 01:26:56.364
If we go down this route,
we better pray none are found.

1556
01:26:58.908 --> 01:27:01.309
I'm gonna get
Elizabeth Wilmshurst's number.

1557
01:27:04.247 --> 01:27:06.773
You've put me
in a rather awkward position.

1558
01:27:06.883 --> 01:27:10.115
I'm sorry, but thank you for seeing me.

1559
01:27:10.987 --> 01:27:12.979
I think what she did took great courage.

1560
01:27:14.023 --> 01:27:17.653
And she was naive, of course, but brave.

1561
01:27:17.861 --> 01:27:20.660
And you were brave enough to resign.

1562
01:27:23.366 --> 01:27:25.232
But not to speak out in public.

1563
01:27:26.569 --> 01:27:29.698
If I had, I might have caused
more of a brouhaha.

1564
01:27:29.839 --> 01:27:31.808
Sparked a proper debate.

1565
01:27:31.908 --> 01:27:35.845
Can I ask you how did you resign?

1566
01:27:40.183 --> 01:27:41.412
I wrote a letter.

1567
01:27:43.086 --> 01:27:45.885
And in that letter, did you give a reason

1568
01:27:46.022 --> 01:27:48.184
for your resignation?

1569
01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:51.352
I restated my position
on the legality of going to war.

1570
01:27:51.461 --> 01:27:52.690
Which was?

1571
01:27:53.296 --> 01:27:55.663
That it would not be lawful to use force

1572
01:27:55.765 --> 01:27:58.758
without a new Security Council resolution.

1573
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:03.599
Did Goldsmith initially
support your view?

1574
01:28:04.908 --> 01:28:06.740
He did.

1575
01:28:06.876 --> 01:28:09.038
He told Blair that
if military action were taken,

1576
01:28:09.145 --> 01:28:11.011
he expected the government to be accused

1577
01:28:11.114 --> 01:28:13.515
of acting unlawfully.

1578
01:28:15.151 --> 01:28:17.711
And was that a written opinion?

1579
01:28:19.122 --> 01:28:21.023
It was a detailed advisory document.

1580
01:28:23.059 --> 01:28:26.359
Right, so then would that
have been his position

1581
01:28:26.462 --> 01:28:29.261
at the time that Katharine Gun
printed the Koza memo

1582
01:28:29.399 --> 01:28:30.867
on February 3?

1583
01:28:33.436 --> 01:28:34.436
Yes.

1584
01:28:36.973 --> 01:28:38.771
And then he went to Washington.

1585
01:28:39.676 --> 01:28:41.372
Really?

1586
01:28:41.477 --> 01:28:45.778
- Well, who did he meet there?
- I wasn't given details.

1587
01:28:47.183 --> 01:28:50.085
But after that trip, his opinion changed.

1588
01:28:50.787 --> 01:28:53.814
In nine short paragraphs, he said that

1589
01:28:53.957 --> 01:28:57.291
the UN's authorization
for the 1991 Gulf War

1590
01:28:57.427 --> 01:28:59.828
could be reactivated

1591
01:28:59.963 --> 01:29:02.398
to legitimize a new war with Iraq.

1592
01:29:02.498 --> 01:29:05.491
He told the Prime Minister
what he wanted to hear?

1593
01:29:05.635 --> 01:29:07.661
At best, he was persuaded to support

1594
01:29:07.804 --> 01:29:10.239
a really fringe point of view.

1595
01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.969
- Really fringe.
- Yeah.

1596
01:29:19.282 --> 01:29:20.773
- Martin Bright.
- Martin.

1597
01:29:20.883 --> 01:29:22.146
- Ben.
<i>- Ben.</i>

1598
01:29:22.285 --> 01:29:23.685
I took your whistleblower's case.

1599
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:26.255
Yes, I heard. Can I meet her?

1600
01:29:26.356 --> 01:29:28.587
No, not yet, Martin.
I don't want a media frenzy.

1601
01:29:28.691 --> 01:29:29.954
Okay. When she's ready.

1602
01:29:30.059 --> 01:29:32.255
Before some hack tracks her down.

1603
01:29:32.362 --> 01:29:34.297
Come on, Ben, I broke her story.
I'm on her side.

1604
01:29:34.397 --> 01:29:36.161
Well, you can help by finding out

1605
01:29:36.299 --> 01:29:38.632
why the Attorney General
went to Washington

1606
01:29:38.735 --> 01:29:40.465
<i>just before the war started.</i>

1607
01:29:40.570 --> 01:29:43.096
Wait, Goldsmith went to DC?

1608
01:29:43.206 --> 01:29:44.697
<i>I'd like to know who he met there.</i>

1609
01:29:44.841 --> 01:29:45.934
<i>Right. I'm on it.</i>

1610
01:29:46.042 --> 01:29:48.477
- And how is Peter?
- Peter is in Iraq.

1611
01:29:48.578 --> 01:29:50.604
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I've been reading his articles.

1612
01:29:50.713 --> 01:29:52.944
Listen, if he hears anything, even a hint

1613
01:29:53.049 --> 01:29:55.985
that Saddam really did have
weapons of mass destruction,

1614
01:29:56.085 --> 01:29:57.178
<i>then please call me.</i>

1615
01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.346
Of course. Can I ask why?

1616
01:29:59.489 --> 01:30:01.549
Well, let's just say
that if WMD are found,

1617
01:30:01.691 --> 01:30:04.684
then defending Katharine will be
a little more complicated.

1618
01:30:04.827 --> 01:30:06.572
- I'll get back to you.
<i>- All right, thank you.</i>

1619
01:30:06.596 --> 01:30:07.859
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

1620
01:30:10.099 --> 01:30:11.795
There's thousands of inspectors here

1621
01:30:11.901 --> 01:30:13.802
from the US Army, the British Army

1622
01:30:13.903 --> 01:30:15.565
the CIA, FBI.

1623
01:30:15.705 --> 01:30:17.071
<i>And still nothing?</i>

1624
01:30:17.206 --> 01:30:20.506
No, no, not a fucking thing. Nothing.

1625
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:23.341
Anyway, some Polish troops found
a cache of Sarin gas warheads

1626
01:30:23.446 --> 01:30:25.727
dating back to the Iran-Iraq
War, but they were all empty.

1627
01:30:25.848 --> 01:30:27.648
<i>And right now, I'm standing
in a glass factory</i>

1628
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:31.414
and all they've found is piles
of silica sand and soda ash.

1629
01:30:33.756 --> 01:30:34.756
So, yeah.

1630
01:30:34.857 --> 01:30:36.689
<i>Things must be getting ugly in Washington.</i>

1631
01:30:36.793 --> 01:30:38.921
Well, you should talk to Ed.

1632
01:30:39.062 --> 01:30:41.327
Maybe we could end up doing
a joint piece or something.

1633
01:30:43.199 --> 01:30:45.600
- Peter, what was that?
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

1634
01:30:45.735 --> 01:30:48.000
It's just our guys detonating
some conventional ordnance.

1635
01:30:48.104 --> 01:30:49.504
- They don't wanna have...
<i>- Jesus.</i>

1636
01:30:49.605 --> 01:30:52.234
...kids finding unexploded shit
in the rubble.

1637
01:30:52.375 --> 01:30:54.844
All right, talk soon. Take care.

1638
01:30:54.944 --> 01:30:57.743
Yeah, all right, mate. Bye.

1639
01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.213
- February 11.
<i>- What?</i>

1640
01:31:00.316 --> 01:31:03.013
<i>Goldsmith's in DC
meeting with the attorneys</i>

1641
01:31:03.119 --> 01:31:05.213
for Bush, Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice.

1642
01:31:05.321 --> 01:31:07.281
<i>- Okay, hold on...</i>
- But that's not the big story.

1643
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:10.519
<i>The really big story is the OSP.</i>

1644
01:31:10.626 --> 01:31:11.958
The Office of Special Plans.

1645
01:31:12.095 --> 01:31:14.621
Turns out when Bush wasn't getting
the intelligence he wanted,

1646
01:31:14.764 --> 01:31:17.427
Rumsfeld bypassed the CIA

1647
01:31:17.567 --> 01:31:19.934
<i>and set up his own intelligence unit.</i>

1648
01:31:20.069 --> 01:31:22.300
They fed raw unvetted intelligence

1649
01:31:22.438 --> 01:31:25.704
to Bush and Powell who lied us into a war!

1650
01:31:25.808 --> 01:31:27.299
Yeah. Okay, Ed. I appreciate that.

1651
01:31:27.443 --> 01:31:28.877
But let's, first, try and help

1652
01:31:28.978 --> 01:31:30.640
a young woman stay out of prison.

1653
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.908
You said Goldsmith met Bush's lawyers

1654
01:31:33.015 --> 01:31:34.984
on February 11. Who were those lawyers?

1655
01:31:35.118 --> 01:31:36.814
"John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales

1656
01:31:36.953 --> 01:31:39.980
William Taft, Jim Haynes, John Bellinger."

1657
01:31:40.123 --> 01:31:43.252
The attorneys for Bush,
Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice.

1658
01:31:43.359 --> 01:31:45.954
Wow. They really turned up the heat.

1659
01:31:46.095 --> 01:31:48.963
You know, I almost feel sorry
for Goldsmith.

1660
01:31:49.098 --> 01:31:52.330
Don't. He fucking caved when
his country needed him most.

1661
01:31:52.468 --> 01:31:54.937
- That's a great headline, mate.
<i>- It bloody is.</i>

1662
01:31:55.037 --> 01:31:56.300
- All right.
<i>- Print it.</i>

1663
01:31:56.439 --> 01:31:57.998
- Yeah. Bye.
<i>- We'll share the byline.</i>

1664
01:31:58.141 --> 01:31:59.575
Bye.

1665
01:31:59.675 --> 01:32:00.675
Nutter.

1666
01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:02.904
<i>Goldsmith was under tremendous pressure</i>

1667
01:32:03.012 --> 01:32:04.412
<i>before he went to Washington.</i>

1668
01:32:04.514 --> 01:32:06.176
Our military were refusing to invade

1669
01:32:06.315 --> 01:32:07.835
without a clear legal opinion from him

1670
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:09.350
that what they were doing was legal

1671
01:32:09.452 --> 01:32:11.011
<i>in case of a war crimes trial.</i>

1672
01:32:11.154 --> 01:32:12.918
Thank you, Martin, very helpful.

1673
01:32:13.022 --> 01:32:14.462
Well, no, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1674
01:32:14.557 --> 01:32:15.837
Do you think you have a defense?

1675
01:32:15.958 --> 01:32:17.358
- We're working on it.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1676
01:32:17.493 --> 01:32:19.138
<i>- Let me know when you do.</i>
- Well, you'll hear it in court.

1677
01:32:19.162 --> 01:32:20.528
<i>- Come on, Ben.</i>
- Bye.

1678
01:32:20.897 --> 01:32:22.695
- He's persistent.
- He is.

1679
01:32:22.832 --> 01:32:23.959
But it's your story

1680
01:32:24.066 --> 01:32:26.035
and you don't need a media trial.

1681
01:32:26.836 --> 01:32:29.772
We should request full disclosure
of all legal advice

1682
01:32:29.872 --> 01:32:33.206
given by Goldsmith in the year
leading up to the invasion.

1683
01:32:33.342 --> 01:32:35.038
He'll almost certainly refuse to comply.

1684
01:32:35.178 --> 01:32:37.010
Then we'll subpoena Wilmshurst.

1685
01:32:37.146 --> 01:32:39.945
Hell, we'll subpoena Goldsmith
himself. And Blair too.

1686
01:32:40.049 --> 01:32:44.145
Ben, if we can't prove that
Goldsmith changed his advice,

1687
01:32:44.253 --> 01:32:47.712
we can't argue that Katharine
tried to stop an illegal war.

1688
01:32:48.357 --> 01:32:49.518
What then?

1689
01:32:58.434 --> 01:33:01.996
- Then I'll be found guilty.
- Almost certainly, yes.

1690
01:33:09.345 --> 01:33:12.679
So, do you want to risk it all

1691
01:33:12.782 --> 01:33:17.049
and ask for disclosure
of the government's documents,

1692
01:33:17.787 --> 01:33:19.221
or would you rather plead guilty

1693
01:33:19.355 --> 01:33:21.881
and hope for a reduced sentence?

1694
01:33:30.066 --> 01:33:31.261
I think...

1695
01:33:33.269 --> 01:33:36.433
...we were lied into an illegal war.

1696
01:33:42.545 --> 01:33:44.377
Let's ask for the documents.

1697
01:33:50.786 --> 01:33:51.845
All right.

1698
01:34:22.151 --> 01:34:23.779
You ready?

1699
01:34:23.919 --> 01:34:25.649
No statements now, remember.

1700
01:34:25.788 --> 01:34:27.416
Let's just get through those doors.

1701
01:34:50.713 --> 01:34:52.978
- Katharine, you okay?
- Yeah.

1702
01:34:53.115 --> 01:34:54.777
Ben's already in the courtroom

1703
01:34:54.884 --> 01:34:57.115
but he wanted you to meet Martin Bright.

1704
01:34:57.219 --> 01:34:59.450
He's covering the trial.

1705
01:34:59.555 --> 01:35:01.456
Katharine, it's an honor.

1706
01:35:01.557 --> 01:35:03.992
I'll be in the press gallery.
I hope that's all right?

1707
01:35:04.126 --> 01:35:06.755
Yeah, yeah. You...

1708
01:35:06.862 --> 01:35:09.297
You took a real risk.

1709
01:35:09.398 --> 01:35:11.264
No, you took the risk.

1710
01:35:11.367 --> 01:35:12.811
I think what you did was extraordinary.

1711
01:35:12.835 --> 01:35:15.361
I think what you exposed
was extraordinary.

1712
01:35:15.504 --> 01:35:17.268
All our institutions failed us.

1713
01:35:17.373 --> 01:35:19.053
The government, the intelligence services,

1714
01:35:19.175 --> 01:35:22.202
the press, they failed us categorically.

1715
01:35:22.345 --> 01:35:25.008
Even my own paper supported
the war before that memo.

1716
01:35:25.147 --> 01:35:26.325
Well, thank you for being here.

1717
01:35:26.349 --> 01:35:28.545
No, thank you.

1718
01:35:28.684 --> 01:35:31.813
It's important what you did. It matters.

1719
01:35:33.556 --> 01:35:35.889
- We should go in, Martin.
- Yes.

1720
01:35:36.025 --> 01:35:39.484
Sorry, James. Yes. Be strong.

1721
01:35:42.264 --> 01:35:44.529
Katharine, you're going that way.

1722
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.366
Can I just have a moment?

1723
01:35:46.502 --> 01:35:48.198
- Of course.
- Thanks.

1724
01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:53.509
You should leave that behind, ma'am.

1725
01:35:53.609 --> 01:35:56.010
Yeah, sorry,
can I just have a second? Just...

1726
01:36:06.789 --> 01:36:07.789
<i>Janum?</i>

1727
01:36:08.424 --> 01:36:11.417
Hi. I'm about to go in.

1728
01:36:15.564 --> 01:36:16.725
I love you.

1729
01:36:18.267 --> 01:36:19.735
I love you too.

1730
01:36:21.137 --> 01:36:24.403
I'm gonna try and call as soon as I can.

1731
01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.338
<i>I wish I was there with you.</i>

1732
01:36:29.545 --> 01:36:30.706
I know.

1733
01:36:31.914 --> 01:36:33.576
I'm so sorry.

1734
01:36:33.716 --> 01:36:35.912
<i>You have nothing to be sorry for.</i>

1735
01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.754
I'm so proud of you. So proud of you.

1736
01:36:44.126 --> 01:36:45.126
Bye.

1737
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:47.753
Bye.

1738
01:36:54.003 --> 01:36:55.003
Miss?

1739
01:36:56.806 --> 01:36:57.806
Sorry.

1740
01:36:58.641 --> 01:37:00.371
I can take your bag.

1741
01:37:00.476 --> 01:37:02.741
- We'll see you in there, okay?
- Yeah.

1742
01:37:34.343 --> 01:37:36.835
Your scarf and jacket, please.

1743
01:37:42.518 --> 01:37:45.317
Okay, and then if you'll raise your arms.

1744
01:37:59.235 --> 01:38:00.235
Okay.

1745
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:06.768
She's here.

1746
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:09.508
Right. Okay.

1747
01:38:09.645 --> 01:38:10.772
Judge is ready.

1748
01:38:21.056 --> 01:38:22.115
Up you go.

1749
01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.077
Are you Katharine Teresa Gun?

1750
01:38:47.216 --> 01:38:48.216
Yes.

1751
01:38:48.284 --> 01:38:51.914
I'm sorry. Can you speak up, please?

1752
01:38:52.054 --> 01:38:53.386
Yes, I am.

1753
01:38:53.522 --> 01:38:55.889
"Katharine Teresa Gun,

1754
01:38:56.025 --> 01:38:57.425
"you are charged with an offense

1755
01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.587
"contrary to Section 1, Subsection 1

1756
01:39:00.729 --> 01:39:04.359
"of the Official Secrets Act of 1989.

1757
01:39:04.466 --> 01:39:08.562
"In that between January 30
and March 2 of 2003

1758
01:39:08.704 --> 01:39:11.105
"you did knowingly and intentionally

1759
01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.039
"disclose top secret
intelligence information

1760
01:39:14.143 --> 01:39:16.612
"contrary to the said act."

1761
01:39:16.745 --> 01:39:20.375
How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?

1762
01:39:22.818 --> 01:39:24.013
Ms. Gun?

1763
01:39:27.289 --> 01:39:28.587
Not guilty.

1764
01:39:32.895 --> 01:39:35.091
Yes, Mr. Ellison.

1765
01:39:39.101 --> 01:39:41.036
Yes, thank you, My Lord.

1766
01:39:42.304 --> 01:39:45.103
My Lord, in light of recent developments,

1767
01:39:45.975 --> 01:39:48.308
the prosecution will offer no evidence

1768
01:39:48.444 --> 01:39:50.970
against the defendant on this indictment.

1769
01:39:52.648 --> 01:39:54.207
I beg your pardon?

1770
01:39:56.852 --> 01:40:00.084
My Lord, the prosecution
will not pursue the indictment.

1771
01:40:00.189 --> 01:40:01.248
Today?

1772
01:40:02.458 --> 01:40:04.791
- No, My Lord.
- I'm sorry.

1773
01:40:04.927 --> 01:40:07.988
Are you asking
for an adjournment, Mr. Ellison?

1774
01:40:09.264 --> 01:40:10.596
No, My Lord.

1775
01:40:10.699 --> 01:40:12.463
You are saying that you do not wish

1776
01:40:12.601 --> 01:40:15.594
to proceed at all?

1777
01:40:15.704 --> 01:40:19.334
- Yes, My Lord.
- But the accused confessed.

1778
01:40:20.676 --> 01:40:21.676
Yes, My Lord.

1779
01:40:21.777 --> 01:40:24.474
And yet you do not wish to proceed?

1780
01:40:24.613 --> 01:40:25.979
- No, My Lord.
- I'm sorry.

1781
01:40:26.115 --> 01:40:28.311
I find that extraordinary.

1782
01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:30.180
Do you care to explain?

1783
01:40:33.122 --> 01:40:36.422
My Lord, the accused submitted
an unusual defense.

1784
01:40:36.525 --> 01:40:38.926
Yes. The defense of necessity.

1785
01:40:39.028 --> 01:40:40.690
- Yes.
- And?

1786
01:40:40.829 --> 01:40:43.924
And we do not believe we have
sufficient evidence to rebut it.

1787
01:40:44.033 --> 01:40:45.763
Why not? She confessed.

1788
01:40:45.868 --> 01:40:47.496
Because, My Lord,

1789
01:40:47.636 --> 01:40:50.504
the documents that
we have called for would show

1790
01:40:50.639 --> 01:40:54.098
that this country was taken
to war illegally...

1791
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:57.836
...and may expose

1792
01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:01.280
the government to charges of war crimes.

1793
01:41:01.383 --> 01:41:03.648
- That is absurd!
- Is it?

1794
01:41:05.587 --> 01:41:07.556
Then kindly hand over the documents

1795
01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:09.818
that we have asked to see.

1796
01:41:10.659 --> 01:41:12.259
My Lord, the prosecution is not obliged.

1797
01:41:12.327 --> 01:41:15.661
Indeed, it is not permitted to continue
with a case if it does not believe

1798
01:41:15.764 --> 01:41:18.165
there is a realistic prospect
of a conviction.

1799
01:41:18.267 --> 01:41:20.463
To do so would be a waste
of taxpayers' funds.

1800
01:41:20.569 --> 01:41:22.299
My Lord, I am thankful

1801
01:41:22.404 --> 01:41:25.499
that the charges against
Ms. Gun are being withdrawn

1802
01:41:25.607 --> 01:41:28.042
and that the Crown
is suddenly so determined

1803
01:41:28.177 --> 01:41:30.305
not to waste taxpayers' money.

1804
01:41:30.412 --> 01:41:33.576
But surely, after months of uncertainty

1805
01:41:33.716 --> 01:41:37.983
and severe distress,
Ms. Gun is entitled to know

1806
01:41:38.087 --> 01:41:40.852
why the government is dropping this case?

1807
01:41:40.956 --> 01:41:43.926
Indeed, the public is entitled to know.

1808
01:41:44.059 --> 01:41:45.755
- Hear, hear.
- Hear.

1809
01:41:48.464 --> 01:41:49.864
Mr. Ellison?

1810
01:41:53.235 --> 01:41:54.931
Again, My Lord, we do not feel

1811
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:57.835
we have a realistic prospect
of a conviction.

1812
01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:59.841
There is nothing more I can say.

1813
01:42:00.876 --> 01:42:02.401
To be clear,

1814
01:42:02.544 --> 01:42:06.606
you are withdrawing all charges

1815
01:42:06.749 --> 01:42:09.116
against Katharine Teresa Gun?

1816
01:42:12.454 --> 01:42:13.513
Yes, My Lord.

1817
01:42:24.399 --> 01:42:25.594
Ms. Gun...

1818
01:42:31.106 --> 01:42:32.540
...you are free to go.

1819
01:43:08.377 --> 01:43:11.176
<i>In a startling about-turn,
the Crown Prosecution Service</i>

1820
01:43:11.313 --> 01:43:13.339
<i>has dropped its case
against an intelligence...</i>

1821
01:43:13.482 --> 01:43:16.611
<i>At 29, Katharine Gun was
facing jail for breaking the...</i>

1822
01:43:16.718 --> 01:43:18.096
<i>The last thing the government wanted</i>

1823
01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.430
<i>within months of a general election</i>

1824
01:43:19.454 --> 01:43:20.615
<i>was a big court case</i>

1825
01:43:20.722 --> 01:43:22.850
<i>focusing on the legality of that war...</i>

1826
01:43:31.633 --> 01:43:34.125
<i>And he was involved in deciding
whether today's case...</i>

1827
01:43:39.575 --> 01:43:42.875
<i>First tonight, Katharine Gun walks free.</i>

1828
01:43:43.011 --> 01:43:44.809
<i>In a dramatic about-turn, the Crown...</i>

1829
01:43:44.913 --> 01:43:46.506
<i>So did the Attorney General</i>

1830
01:43:46.648 --> 01:43:48.310
<i>put pressure on to stop the trial?</i>

1831
01:43:48.417 --> 01:43:50.045
<i>Did GCHQ?</i>

1832
01:43:50.185 --> 01:43:52.381
<i>Did the prime minister? No answers.</i>

1833
01:43:52.521 --> 01:43:54.001
<i>Tonight we're simply asked to believe</i>

1834
01:43:54.089 --> 01:43:56.718
<i>that there was no case to answer.</i>

1835
01:44:00.362 --> 01:44:02.627
Would you do it again?

1836
01:44:02.731 --> 01:44:04.666
- Would you do it again?
- I have no regrets.

1837
01:44:04.766 --> 01:44:06.792
Yes, and I would do it again, yes.

1838
01:44:22.551 --> 01:44:23.712
Caught anything?

1839
01:44:25.087 --> 01:44:26.248
Not yet.

1840
01:44:40.936 --> 01:44:43.735
You know, it wasn't my choice
to prosecute.

1841
01:44:45.807 --> 01:44:49.175
I was bound by the decision
of the Attorney General.

1842
01:44:50.712 --> 01:44:54.080
Why did you keep her
in a state of distress

1843
01:44:54.216 --> 01:44:57.584
for a year before you brought charges?

1844
01:44:58.654 --> 01:45:01.522
The services wanted to make
an example of her.

1845
01:45:02.391 --> 01:45:05.190
If we dropped the case any earlier,

1846
01:45:05.294 --> 01:45:07.889
what kind of message would that have sent?

1847
01:45:12.935 --> 01:45:14.733
Do me a favor, Ken.

1848
01:45:15.604 --> 01:45:17.402
Go and fish somewhere else.
