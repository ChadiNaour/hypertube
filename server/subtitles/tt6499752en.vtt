I love you.

You can't be an
idealist and a capitalist, Asha.

13
00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:25.966
- You got to pick a side.
- I think I can.

14
00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:27.502
No, you can't.
I'm... I'm telling you...

00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:37.276
Goodbye, Handley.

20
00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.548
I'm fine.

21
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.984
My husband scared me.

22
00:03:50.123 --> 00:03:52.557
You do realize that you're
talking to a car, right?

23
00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.091
I hear you talking
to yours all the time.

24
00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:56.360
At least, mine can talk back.

25
00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:57.428
Hmm.

26
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.331
Oh, working hard, I see.

27

Oh, thanks, Kara.

33
00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:18.514
Order them.

34
00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:22.048
Actually,
I was working very hard today.

35
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.184
In fact, that right there
is the celebratory beer.

36
00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:27.286
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

37
00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:29.054
I dropped the block
in the Firebird today,

38
00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:30.323
finished her up.
You wanna see?

39
00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:33.224
I have no idea
what you just said.

40
00:04:33.226 --> 00:04:35.193
Okay. Well, I don't know
what you do

41
00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:37.396
for a living either, wife,
so we're even.

42
00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:40.063
Yes, but is staying home all day

43
00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:42.467
playing with cars
a living, Grey?

44
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.268
I don't know. Dunno.

45
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.537
Ow.

46
00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.069
That hurt.

47
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:48.072
It hurt good.

48
00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:51.274
- Yeah.
- You know what?

49
00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:53.075
I'm actually getting
kind of used to you

50
00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:55.043
wearing the pants
in this household.

51
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.547
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm really settling in.

52
00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:59.315
Stop it.

53
00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:01.617
Well, you know, I'm never
giving them back, so...

54
00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:03.217
I bet you 10 bucks
I can get 'em off.

55
00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.285
No.

56
00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:05.422
Stop.

57
00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:09.122
You want to print a pizza?

58
00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:11.392
You wanna make a pizza?

59
00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.059
Seems like a lot of work.

60
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:14.294
Oh. I got to drop the car off

61
00:05:14.296 --> 00:05:15.496
to this guy tonight,
it's all done.

62
00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:18.197
Oh. Boo.
Okay. Well, have fun.

63
00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.098
What do you mean have fun?
You're coming with me.

64
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.568
- What?
- Yeah.

65
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.503
I need you to drive me home
in that toy car of yours.

66
00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:24.604
It's, like, 45 minutes away.

67
00:05:24.606 --> 00:05:26.037
I'll push a button and end up

68
00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.238
in Canada or something.

69
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.374
Well, I have work to do,
so I can't.

70
00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:31.477
Can't lives
on Won't Street, lady.

71
00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.344
You're coming with me.
And believe me,

72
00:05:33.346 --> 00:05:36.246
you're gonna wanna see
this guy's house.

73
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:37.282
Trust me.

74
00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:33.295
So, what, he lives
behind the rocks?

75
00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:35.065
No. Just you wait.

76
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:40.570
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

77
00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:41.573
Really.

78
00:06:55.418 --> 00:06:56.450
After you.

79
00:06:56.452 --> 00:06:57.654
What?

80
00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:11.194
This is amazing.

81
00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:14.133
Eron, my man.

82
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.338
I got the Firebird upstairs
ready to go.

83
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.573
- You're early.
- Yeah. I...

84
00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.341
I drive fast.

85
00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:27.275
What... what is... what is the
thing that you're touching?

86
00:07:27.277 --> 00:07:29.480
It's my cloud.

87
00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:35.483
Eron, I'd like you to meet

88
00:07:35.485 --> 00:07:37.321
my wife, Asha.

89
00:07:38.555 --> 00:07:41.222
Hi. Nice to meet you.

90
00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:45.759
Hi. Yes.

91
00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:47.260
Hello.

92
00:07:47.262 --> 00:07:48.429
Hi.

93
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:49.463
Wait.

94
00:07:49.465 --> 00:07:51.464
You're Eron Keen.

95
00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:54.667
You own Vessel Computers.
Oh, my God.

96
00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:56.502
Husband did not tell me
who I was meeting.

97
00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:58.537
I... I really love your company.

98
00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:00.639
You do
the most incredible things.

99
00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:03.609
I'm in the industry too.
I work for Cobolt.

100
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:05.611
We specialize in robotic limbs

101
00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:06.944
for wounded soldiers.

102
00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:08.512
I mean, we're nothing
like Vessel yet,

103
00:08:08.514 --> 00:08:09.616
but we're getting there.

104
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.284
No, you're not.

105
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:18.255
I'll show you why.

106
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.392
Follow me.

107
00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:25.761
I would like to introduce
you to my present

108
00:08:25.763 --> 00:08:28.396
and the rest
of the world's future.

109
00:08:28.398 --> 00:08:30.132
I call it Stem.

110
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:33.401
Wow.

111
00:08:33.403 --> 00:08:36.202
That is the most incredible
little roach.

112
00:08:36.204 --> 00:08:37.304
What does it do?

113
00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:38.672
Literally anything.

114
00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:40.507
Hmm.

115
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:42.709
It can drive anything,
talk to anything,

116
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:45.544
calculate anything.

117
00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:47.682
It's a new, better brain.

118
00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:52.684
Can it make babies
and play football?

119
00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:55.252
It can do things
that will benefit society.

120
00:08:55.254 --> 00:08:56.521
Okay. You know what he means.

121
00:08:56.523 --> 00:08:58.287
I'm just saying,
there's some things

122
00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:00.289
that people do better.
I mean, you look at that widget

123
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:01.725
and you see the future.
I look at that thing,

124
00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:03.663
I see 10 guys
on an unemployment line.

125
00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:13.301
You should try not
to argue with that guy.

126
00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.470
He's your last paying customer.

127
00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.439
<i>Please do not touch
the steering wheel</i>

128
00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:19.708
<i>while the car is in motion.</i>

129
00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:23.511
Okay. So what's a guy
like me supposed to do

130
00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:26.683
when his widget starts
taking over the world, hmm?

131
00:09:28.016 --> 00:09:29.817
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

132
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.218
Come here.

133
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:41.460
You know,
there are some benefits

134
00:09:41.462 --> 00:09:43.662
not having to keep
your eyes on the road.

135
00:09:43.664 --> 00:09:44.797
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

136
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.467
What should I
keep my eyes on?

137
00:09:53.338 --> 00:09:55.037
<i>Please put
your seatbelts on.</i>

138
00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:57.507
- No fun.
- Hmm.

139
00:09:57.509 --> 00:10:00.344
<i>Leaving 601 freeway.</i>

140
00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:26.499
Hey, honey, where...
where are we?

141
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.467
She's probably just taking us
around the traffic.

142
00:10:28.469 --> 00:10:29.868
No, no, no.

143
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.869
Wait. I'm sorry.
This is... no.

144
00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:33.505
This is my old neighborhood.

145
00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:35.372
This is where I grew up.
Yeah, this is New Crown.

146
00:10:35.374 --> 00:10:37.074
We're... I mean, we're going
in the exact opposite

147
00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:38.776
- direction of the house.
- Kara, take us home.

148
00:10:38.778 --> 00:10:41.481
<i>I'm sorry.
There has been an error.</i>

149
00:10:42.782 --> 00:10:44.782
Return to the freeway,
destination home.

150
00:10:44.784 --> 00:10:47.417
<i>I'm sorry.
There has been an error.</i>

151
00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:49.519
- What?
- Stop, car.

152
00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:50.655
Car, stop.

153
00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:54.558
Press the brake twice.

154
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:59.362
<i>Turning left.</i>

155
00:11:00.897 --> 00:11:02.697
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

156
00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:04.734
- Stop.
- Let me try this.

157
00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:08.101
We're going a little too fast.

158
00:11:08.103 --> 00:11:09.805
This is not supposed to be...

159
00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:15.309
Shit.

160
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:40.463
<i>There has been
an accident.</i>

161

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:42.931

00:12:00.849 --> 00:12:01.849
Grey.

165
00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:09.557
Here to help.

166
00:12:12.393 --> 00:12:13.594
Wait.

167
00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:15.728
Who are you guys?

168
00:12:18.698 --> 00:12:19.963
Wait.

169
00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:21.666
Back up. Back up.

170
00:12:21.668 --> 00:12:23.435
Stay right there, partner.

171
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.469
We're on TV, assholes.

172
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:27.506
Hurry.

173
00:12:36.681 --> 00:12:39.480
Hey, what are you doing?
Put your mask back on.

174
00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:41.982
Look, you guys,
you can have my wallet,

175
00:12:41.984 --> 00:12:43.518
take our cards, okay?

176
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.952
You can have it all.

177
00:12:44.954 --> 00:12:46.987
Thanks for your permission.

178
00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:48.957
Don't you fucking
touch her.

179
00:12:50.626 --> 00:12:52.892
You look at me and see
a real piece of shit

180
00:12:52.894 --> 00:12:56.027
on your shoe, don't you?

181
00:12:56.029 --> 00:12:58.664
A learned woman like yourself

182
00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:04.438
looking down on an
uneducated insect like me.

183
00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:07.938
No!

184
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.006
No!

185
00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:11.709
No!

186
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:13.910
There's four hostiles,
two prone.

187
00:13:16.514 --> 00:13:18.013
Asha!

188
00:13:18.015 --> 00:13:19.517
Asha!

189
00:13:27.658 --> 00:13:29.857
Till death do us part.

190
00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:38.665
Asha, I can't get to you.

191
00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:40.000
I can't move.

192
00:13:40.002 --> 00:13:43.670
Asha, stay with me, okay?

193
00:13:43.672 --> 00:13:45.406
Look at me, honey.

194
00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:48.840
Okay. I'm right here.

195
00:13:48.842 --> 00:13:50.778
I'm right here, okay, Asha?

196
00:13:55.248 --> 00:13:57.517
I'm right here. Okay?

197
00:13:59.852 --> 00:14:00.951
No. No. Asha.

198
00:14:00.953 --> 00:14:02.021
Asha, no. Pl...

199
00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:41.638
Getting around,
you're gonna need this,

200
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.974
they're all throughout
the house.

201
00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:48.111
I mean, everything that's
installed just allows you

202
00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:51.616
to live a more normal life.

203
00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:56.917
Oh, these robotic arms
are fully capable

204
00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:58.953
of preparing meals for you.

205
00:15:58.955 --> 00:16:01.889
Let's say you wanted
a protein shake,

206
00:16:01.891 --> 00:16:04.527
you would just say,
"Protein shake."

207
00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:11.830
Your mother also has voice
control authority

208
00:16:11.832 --> 00:16:13.132
over the arms.

209
00:16:13.134 --> 00:16:14.933
Would you like to do
the honors, ma'am?

210
00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:18.103
Heh. Sure.

211
00:16:18.105 --> 00:16:20.071
Protein shake.

212
00:16:20.073 --> 00:16:23.009
Oh, my Lord. Ha, ha.

213
00:16:33.685 --> 00:16:35.821
Oh, heh...

214
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:38.056
There you go.

215
00:16:41.192 --> 00:16:42.924
I think we'll be fine
from here.

216
00:16:42.926 --> 00:16:44.760
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out.

217
00:16:44.762 --> 00:16:45.929
Oh, thank you.

218
00:16:57.407 --> 00:16:59.974
<i>Charging now complete.</i>

219
00:17:16.722 --> 00:17:17.922
<i>Are you there, Grey?</i>

220
00:17:17.924 --> 00:17:20.123
<i>Would you like something?</i>

221
00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.859
<i>May I ask if Asha
will be joining us</i>

222
00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:24.596
<i>for dinner?</i>

223
00:17:44.012 --> 00:17:45.746
You know,
you don't have to stay here

224
00:17:45.748 --> 00:17:47.781
day and night, Mom.

225
00:17:47.783 --> 00:17:50.015
You know, these machines
they installed

226
00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:53.886
pretty much do
everything for me.

227
00:17:53.888 --> 00:17:55.089
I know.

228
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:07.097
Now, it's okay.

229
00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:08.265
It's okay.

230
00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:10.102
That's it. That's it. That's it.

231
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.817
Detective Cortez.

232
00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:08.951
Hi, Pam.

233
00:19:08.953 --> 00:19:10.054
Hi, Grey.

234
00:19:15.825 --> 00:19:16.891
All right. This is me.

235
00:19:16.893 --> 00:19:18.126
Here. You can have a seat here.

236
00:19:18.128 --> 00:19:19.162
Thanks.

237
00:19:24.133 --> 00:19:27.234
You know, I'm from New Crown,
Grey, like you.

238
00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:29.235
Went to Hellier High.

239
00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:30.238
So what do you have?

240
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.106
Okay.

241
00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:35.775
I know you were anxious
to come down here

242
00:19:35.777 --> 00:19:37.108
and see how
we're getting things done,

243
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.311
and I think that's great.

244
00:19:38.313 --> 00:19:39.978
I'm a face-to-face
person myself.

245
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.279
You know,
I don't pilot these drones.

246
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:42.947
I like to get my hands dirty.

247
00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:45.017
- Bang on doors.
- So who are these guys?

248
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.021
We don't know yet.

249
00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:53.256
I do have a list of people
of interest in that area.

250
00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:55.326
And just this week,
I brought in two people

251
00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:57.126
- for questioning.
- So what you're saying

252
00:19:57.128 --> 00:19:59.261
is you have all these things
flying above our heads,

253
00:19:59.263 --> 00:20:00.996
they can read the ID chips
in our fillings,

254
00:20:00.998 --> 00:20:02.864
but they don't actually
do anything?

255
00:20:02.866 --> 00:20:05.234
No. I... I mean, yes, they work,

256
00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:06.867
but it's not that simple.

257
00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:09.036
Criminals can find ways
around them.

258
00:20:09.038 --> 00:20:10.405
If they can find
the right people,

259
00:20:10.407 --> 00:20:12.273
criminals can get a firewall
built around them

260
00:20:12.275 --> 00:20:14.841
that prevents our drones
from identifying their faces.

261
00:20:14.843 --> 00:20:17.411
Believe me, I understand
your frustration, I do.

262
00:20:17.413 --> 00:20:19.212
I know I can't tie
my shoes anymore, Detective,

263
00:20:19.214 --> 00:20:20.414
but you don't have
to talk to me

264
00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:22.315
like I'm a goddamn
three-year-old.

265
00:20:22.317 --> 00:20:24.183
Grey, she's just trying
to help.

266
00:20:24.185 --> 00:20:25.385
I'm going to work
through my list,

267
00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:27.420
and if you want to work with me,

268
00:20:27.422 --> 00:20:30.021
we're gonna find them.

269
00:20:30.023 --> 00:20:32.793
How can I work with you?
I can't even stand.

270
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:41.767
Administer p.m. medicine.

271
00:20:58.014 --> 00:20:59.046
Problem.

272
00:20:59.048 --> 00:21:01.250
Administer p.m. medicine.

273
00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:10.393
Again.
Administer p.m. medicine.

274
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.828
Problem. Again.

275
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:17.363
Again.

276
00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:18.930
<i>I cannot administer</i>

277
00:21:18.932 --> 00:21:20.299
<i>any more medication, Grey.</i>

278
00:21:20.302 --> 00:21:22.066
No. You... you didn't do it
right.

279
00:21:22.068 --> 00:21:24.235
You didn't do...
you didn't do it right.

280
00:21:24.237 --> 00:21:26.971
Administer p.m. medicine.

281
00:21:26.973 --> 00:21:29.308
<i>Another dosage
could be fatal.</i>

282
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.975
<i>I will contact an ambulance
to transport you</i>

283
00:21:31.977 --> 00:21:34.945
<i>to a hospital
if you are in serious pain.</i>

284
00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:07.309
Not gonna give you
bird flu, kid.

285
00:22:09.377 --> 00:22:11.978
I don't leave my house
very often.

286
00:22:17.183 --> 00:22:19.319
Must be frustrating for you.

287
00:22:22.087 --> 00:22:25.123
You're someone who liked to get
things done with their hands.

288
00:22:26.991 --> 00:22:28.193
Now you can't.

289
00:22:32.129 --> 00:22:34.464
I'm sorry.
Was that inappropriate?

290
00:22:34.466 --> 00:22:37.400
I'm not around enough people
to know the difference.

291
00:22:37.402 --> 00:22:38.501
Okay. Here's the difference.

292
00:22:38.503 --> 00:22:40.337
What the fuck do you want, Eron?

293
00:22:44.005 --> 00:22:45.341
Grey...

294
00:22:48.009 --> 00:22:50.009
What if I told you
I could offer you something

295
00:22:50.011 --> 00:22:53.447
that would enable you
to walk again?

296
00:22:53.449 --> 00:22:55.415
That computer chip
that I showed you,

297
00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:58.418
it has the potential to change

298
00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.951
everything for people

299
00:22:59.953 --> 00:23:03.054
in your condition.

300
00:23:03.056 --> 00:23:06.157
As a quadriplegic,
the line connecting your brain

301
00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:08.160
to your limbs has been cut,

302
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.499
Stem would bridge that gap.

303
00:23:15.032 --> 00:23:17.334
The operation would take
place in my home,

304
00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:20.437
away from official eyes.

305
00:23:20.439 --> 00:23:23.440
There'd be no more
hospitals,

306
00:23:23.442 --> 00:23:27.309
but it would have to be
our secret...

307
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:28.911
for now.

308
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.282
Here's the thing, kid.

309
00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:39.321
I'm not looking to restart
my life.

310
00:23:41.189 --> 00:23:43.426
I'm looking
for the off switch.

311
00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:54.301
You know...

312
00:23:55.335 --> 00:23:57.170
you were right about them.

313
00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:00.472
Computers,

314
00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:02.542
there are things
that they can't do.

315
00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:06.242
They can't bring her back, Grey,

316
00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:09.980
but they just might be able
to bring you back.

317
00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:20.357
What would she want?

318
00:25:38.156 --> 00:25:40.525
<i>This is a world first.</i>

319
00:25:40.527 --> 00:25:43.159
<i>Never before
has a biomechanical fusion</i>

320
00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:45.162
<i>been asked to do so much.</i>

321
00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:50.199
<i>It's going to feel strange
initially.</i>

322
00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:52.167
<i>The neural pathways
in your brain</i>

323
00:25:52.169 --> 00:25:54.168
<i>will be trying
to have a conversation</i>

324
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.639
<i>with a foreign body,</i>

325
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:58.309
<i>trying to learn to pass
the baton.</i>

326
00:26:00.645 --> 00:26:04.314
<i>The key is to let it grow
into itself.</i>

327
00:26:13.689 --> 00:26:17.157
Grey, can you hear me?

328
00:26:24.331 --> 00:26:27.434
Can you feel it when I do this?

329
00:26:35.206 --> 00:26:38.576
My guess is this is gonna be
a piecemeal process.

330
00:26:38.578 --> 00:26:42.380
You shouldn't be expecting
unreasonable results so soon.

331
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.389
Oh, my God.

332
00:27:10.639 --> 00:27:12.440
Now, try to stand.

333
00:27:45.802 --> 00:27:47.802
<i>Nobody can know.</i>

334
00:27:47.804 --> 00:27:50.537
They make people like me
wait years

335
00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:52.675
to test something like this.

336
00:27:54.274 --> 00:27:57.242
But I can't wait for them.

337
00:27:57.244 --> 00:28:00.278
Signing confidentiality
agreements is never fun,

338
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.213
but I bet it will feel good
to do it

339
00:28:02.215 --> 00:28:03.548
with your own hand.

340
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.584
Who's moving my arms
and my legs,

341
00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:06.685
me or your widget?

342
00:28:06.687 --> 00:28:08.687
You're the one doing it all.

343
00:28:08.689 --> 00:28:09.689
You're not a robot.

344
00:28:11.692 --> 00:28:14.224
Stem works in service
of your brain.

345
00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:15.793
Your brain gives Stem
a command,

346
00:28:15.795 --> 00:28:16.993
he makes it happen.

347
00:28:40.808 --> 00:28:42.207
Close door.

348
00:28:53.617 --> 00:28:55.316
<i>Good evening, Grey.</i>

349
00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:57.652
<i>Another package
from Detective Cortez</i>

350
00:28:57.654 --> 00:28:59.487
<i>has been delivered.
Would you like...</i>

351
00:28:59.489 --> 00:29:00.888
Shut up.

352
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.759
<i>Did you say,
"Shut down"?</i>

353
00:29:03.761 --> 00:29:05.461
Yeah, I did. Shut down.

354
00:30:03.813 --> 00:30:05.679
<i>May I point
something out?</i>

355
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.417
Hello?

356
00:30:13.419 --> 00:30:14.419
<i>Yes?</i>

357
00:30:18.357 --> 00:30:19.758
Okay, who's saying that?

358
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.797
<i>I am Stem. The system
operating your body for you.</i>

359
00:30:25.697 --> 00:30:27.429
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

360
00:30:27.431 --> 00:30:28.834
You fucking kidding me?

361
00:30:30.702 --> 00:30:31.903
<i>No.</i>

362
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:35.670
I've gone insane.

363
00:30:35.672 --> 00:30:38.573
I'm fucking insane.

364
00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:40.542
<i>Your psychological
report diagnosed you</i>

365
00:30:40.544 --> 00:30:44.413
<i>with mild PTSD symptoms,
but you are not insane.</i>

366
00:30:46.415 --> 00:30:47.816
Wait, so... Okay,
you've been sitting there

367
00:30:47.818 --> 00:30:49.784
this whole time since
the operation?

368
00:30:49.786 --> 00:30:51.918
<i>I have been observing
everything you've observed.</i>

369
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.754
Do you... do you have to talk?

370
00:30:53.756 --> 00:30:55.454
<i>If you don't want me to,
I will not.</i>

371
00:30:55.456 --> 00:30:57.357
Okay. Yeah, don't talk.

372
00:31:21.645 --> 00:31:23.614
So I'm not insane?

373
00:31:31.621 --> 00:31:34.421
You can talk again.

374
00:31:34.423 --> 00:31:36.658
<i>No, you are not insane.</i>

375
00:31:37.993 --> 00:31:39.993
Wait, can anybody else hear you?

376
00:31:39.995 --> 00:31:42.461
<i>No, only you.</i>

377
00:31:42.463 --> 00:31:44.899
<i>I'm sending sound waves
to your eardrum.</i>

378
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:49.635
Can you read my mind?

379
00:31:49.637 --> 00:31:50.936
<i>No.</i>

380
00:31:50.938 --> 00:31:52.637
<i>I can only discern speech</i>

381
00:31:52.639 --> 00:31:55.607
<i>when you talk out loud.</i>

382
00:31:55.609 --> 00:31:57.541
<i>Now that you've allowed me
to talk again,</i>

383
00:31:57.543 --> 00:31:59.811
<i>may I point something out?</i>

384
00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:01.848
<i>In the drone
surveillance footage.</i>

385
00:32:06.684 --> 00:32:08.386
<i>Can't you see it?</i>

386
00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:16.892
See what?

387
00:32:16.894 --> 00:32:18.894
<i>The man who shot
your wife,</i>

388
00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:20.929
<i>there's no gun in his hand.</i>

389
00:32:20.931 --> 00:32:22.731
She was shot,
that means he had a gun.

390
00:32:22.733 --> 00:32:24.799
<i>She was shot,
but not with a gun</i>

391
00:32:24.801 --> 00:32:26.801
<i>he was holding in his hand.</i>

392
00:32:26.803 --> 00:32:29.638
<i>A gun implanted inside
his hand.</i>

393
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.642
<i>Freeze the screen
at the moment he fires.</i>

394
00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:41.079
<i>The man who took Asha's purse</i>

395
00:32:41.081 --> 00:32:43.248
<i>in the left of frame,</i>

396
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.652
<i>there is a marking
on his wrist.</i>

397
00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:55.258
I don't see it.

398
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.559
<i>I do.</i>

399
00:32:56.561 --> 00:32:58.094
<i>I've rebuilt the image.</i>

400
00:32:58.096 --> 00:33:00.732
<i>With your permission,
I can show you.</i>

401
00:33:03.702 --> 00:33:06.001
<i>Just relax and let me draw.</i>

402
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:10.638
This feels very weird.

403
00:33:17.714 --> 00:33:20.047
<i>You now have
full control again, Grey.</i>

404
00:33:20.049 --> 00:33:22.548
I've... I've seen these.

405
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.984
It's a... a military tattoo,
I think.

406
00:33:24.986 --> 00:33:26.085
<i>I will read it.</i>

407
00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:27.621
<i>Hold it in front of your eye.</i>

408
00:33:31.925 --> 00:33:33.959
<i>Serk Brantner, Marine Corps,</i>

409
00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:37.062
<i>098-422; O-Positive; Catholic;</i>

410
00:33:37.064 --> 00:33:39.532
<i>address: 414 Citrus, New Crown.</i>

411
00:33:41.067 --> 00:33:42.467
You just...

412
00:33:46.938 --> 00:33:48.640
You just found this guy?

413
00:33:53.078 --> 00:33:55.479
I got you, you sons of bitches.

414
00:33:59.882 --> 00:34:01.983
Call Detective Cortez.

415
00:34:01.985 --> 00:34:03.884
<i>Are you sure you want</i>

416
00:34:03.886 --> 00:34:06.787
- <i>to call Detective Cortez?</i>
- Yes. I am sure.

417
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:07.988
You just found the guy

418
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.757
who murdered my wife.

419
00:34:09.759 --> 00:34:11.660
<i>Do you have evidence
to prove that?</i>

420
00:34:13.862 --> 00:34:14.862
End call.

421
00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:19.999
Well, you saw the tattoo.

422
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:22.602
<i>Eron has forbidden you
to tell anyone about me.</i>

423
00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:27.939
Okay. Maybe I... I drew it
from memory.

424
00:34:27.941 --> 00:34:29.707
<i>My reconstruction
of the tattoo</i>

425
00:34:29.709 --> 00:34:31.675
<i>does not provide
any real evidence</i>

426
00:34:31.677 --> 00:34:34.644
<i>unless they can correlate it
exactly with the drone video,</i>

427
00:34:34.646 --> 00:34:37.114
- <i>which they can't.</i>
- What are you saying?

428
00:34:37.116 --> 00:34:38.948
<i>You need to be positive
it's him</i>

429
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:40.685
<i>before you alert the police.</i>

430
00:34:43.789 --> 00:34:46.556
Hey, man, he was the last one...

431
00:34:47.825 --> 00:34:48.985
Sure, they do, but then he...

432
00:35:07.674 --> 00:35:08.741
Lock chair.

433
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.859
<i>There are no alarms inside,</i>

434
00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:32.395
<i>but it is a manual lock.</i>

435
00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:34.096
<i>I can't help you break it.</i>

436
00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:35.631
Don't worry.

437
00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:36.697
I got this.

438
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.685
<i>I suggest you remove
your shoes.</i>

439
00:36:26.076 --> 00:36:27.644
<i>Grey, the table.</i>

440
00:36:30.147 --> 00:36:31.946
What about it?

441
00:36:31.948 --> 00:36:33.683
<i>Say the word "on."</i>

442
00:36:35.184 --> 00:36:37.251
On.

443
00:36:37.253 --> 00:36:39.120
<i>Say "messages."</i>

444
00:36:39.122 --> 00:36:40.122
Messages.

445
00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:50.162
<i>The name "Old Bones"
keeps being mentioned.</i>

446
00:36:50.164 --> 00:36:52.297
<i>I saw 38 references.
What is that?</i>

447
00:36:52.299 --> 00:36:54.233
It's a bar
in my old neighborhood.

448
00:36:54.235 --> 00:36:57.034
<i>I can find no online
address or phone number for it.</i>

449
00:36:57.036 --> 00:36:59.770
'Cause they don't go in
for that sort of thing.

450
00:36:59.772 --> 00:37:01.905
No, this is useless.

451
00:37:01.907 --> 00:37:02.908
Off.

452
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:43.909
<i>Hide behind the shelf.</i>

453
00:37:53.286 --> 00:37:55.084
<i>Wait.</i>

454
00:37:55.086 --> 00:37:56.087
<i>Wait.</i>

455
00:37:59.825 --> 00:38:01.324
<i>Now.</i>

456
00:38:01.326 --> 00:38:03.160
<i>Now, while you have
the advantage.</i>

457
00:38:12.235 --> 00:38:13.236
Come here!

458
00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:18.038
You come here
to rip me off, huh?

459
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.941
Wait.

460
00:38:20.943 --> 00:38:22.008
It's you.

461
00:38:23.978 --> 00:38:26.946
I don't know how you found me,

462
00:38:26.948 --> 00:38:29.081
but you shouldn't be here.

463
00:38:29.083 --> 00:38:30.983
- You killed my wife.
- No!

464
00:38:30.985 --> 00:38:33.051
I didn't do that.
That was someone else.

465
00:38:33.053 --> 00:38:34.986
It doesn't matter!

466
00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:40.090
<i>You'll need to be
a little faster than that.</i>

467
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.894
Why are you making me do this?

468
00:38:43.896 --> 00:38:46.396
<i>Let me know if you need
my help, Grey.</i>

469
00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:48.332
Stem, help.

470
00:38:48.334 --> 00:38:50.967
<i>I need your permission
to operate independently.</i>

471
00:38:50.969 --> 00:38:52.935
Permission granted.

472
00:38:52.937 --> 00:38:55.805
<i>Thank you.</i>

473
00:39:04.146 --> 00:39:06.914
Um, okay.

474
00:39:06.916 --> 00:39:09.583
Uh, Stem, what are we...
what are we doing, man?

475
00:39:09.585 --> 00:39:11.285
<i>Just relax.</i>

476
00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:14.854
What the fuck?

477
00:39:17.292 --> 00:39:19.258
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Dear God.

478
00:39:22.863 --> 00:39:24.196
Oh, look, man,
stay down, please.

479
00:39:24.198 --> 00:39:26.298
Um, please don't get up.

480
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.999
Please don't get up.
Please...

481
00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:30.868
Stay down, man.

482
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.136
Stem, he's got a knife!

483
00:39:32.138 --> 00:39:33.437
Stem!

484
00:39:33.439 --> 00:39:34.839
<i>I can see that.</i>

485
00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:36.606
<i>We have a knife, too.</i>

486
00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:38.241
Oh.

487
00:39:38.243 --> 00:39:39.875
You just stabbed him.

488
00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:41.411
Are you trying to piss him off?

489
00:39:41.413 --> 00:39:42.911
Okay. All right.

490
00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.313
So, what's the plan?

491
00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:46.115
What are we doing?

492
00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.182
Stem! Stop him.

493
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.861
<i>You now have
full control again, Grey.</i>

494
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:18.310
<i>I advise that you remove
any traces</i>

495
00:40:18.312 --> 00:40:20.944
<i>of your presence here.</i>

496
00:40:20.946 --> 00:40:23.213
<i>That also means cleaning up
the vomit in the sink.</i>

497
00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:26.115
Okay. Just give me...
give me a second, okay?

498
00:40:26.117 --> 00:40:28.184
<i>- One second has passed.</i>
- Look, I don't...

499
00:40:28.186 --> 00:40:31.087
I didn't mean a second,
I just mean hold on, okay?

500
00:40:31.089 --> 00:40:32.288
I gotta think.
I can't let you do

501
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.891
the thinking for me right now.

502
00:40:41.998 --> 00:40:43.964
I just...

503
00:40:43.966 --> 00:40:45.268
I just killed somebody.

504
00:40:54.975 --> 00:40:56.010
So, uh...

505
00:40:59.447 --> 00:41:01.447
What do you think...
What do you think I should do?

506
00:41:01.449 --> 00:41:03.248
<i>I would suggest
that you rid the house</i>

507
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.683
<i>of all your fingerprints.</i>

508
00:41:04.685 --> 00:41:06.250
I... are you kidding me?
I can't remember

509
00:41:06.252 --> 00:41:08.052
every single thing
that I touched here...

510
00:41:08.054 --> 00:41:09.387
<i>I have a record
of every single thing</i>

511
00:41:09.389 --> 00:41:10.856
<i>you touched.</i>

512
00:41:21.299 --> 00:41:23.332
So, the body that came in

513
00:41:23.334 --> 00:41:24.999
from New Crown yesterday,

514
00:41:25.001 --> 00:41:27.235
Serk Brantner?

515
00:41:27.237 --> 00:41:28.471
I wanna show you what I found

516
00:41:28.473 --> 00:41:29.473
when I opened him up.

517
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.976
When I examined the wound
in his throat,

518
00:41:35.978 --> 00:41:38.479
I found wiring embedded
in the tendons.

519
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:40.114
I'm thinking surgery.

520
00:41:40.116 --> 00:41:42.316
A medical implant attached
to the muscle.

521
00:41:42.318 --> 00:41:45.418
I also found computer implants
all throughout his chest.

522
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.421
I've never seen them
to this extent before.

523
00:41:48.423 --> 00:41:50.724
- And then there's this.
- What is it?

524
00:41:50.726 --> 00:41:52.491
Appears to be some sort
of weapon implant

525
00:41:52.493 --> 00:41:54.226
embedded within the muscle,

526
00:41:54.228 --> 00:41:56.026
an actual functioning gun,

527
00:41:56.028 --> 00:41:58.362
with a bullet-loading mechanism

528
00:41:58.364 --> 00:42:01.999
built into the tissue
with biomechanics.

529
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:03.967
What about the boot print
we scraped

530
00:42:03.969 --> 00:42:05.070
from the front porch?

531
00:42:08.273 --> 00:42:10.108
Engine grease, mostly.

532
00:42:11.343 --> 00:42:13.976
Old-fashioned engine grease.

533
00:42:18.516 --> 00:42:21.215
So how am I progressing?

534
00:42:21.217 --> 00:42:24.118
I can track you, Grey.

535
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.521
- Huh?
- I can track you.

536
00:42:26.523 --> 00:42:28.422
Wait. Am I supposed
to know what that means

537
00:42:28.424 --> 00:42:30.123
or is that
one of your brain tests?

538
00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:31.759
It means you have a piece
of my property

539
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:33.160
inside of you.

540
00:42:33.162 --> 00:42:35.194
A very expensive piece
of property.

541
00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:37.365
Serk Brantner,
homicide suspect list.

542
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.200
Did you really think

543
00:42:41.202 --> 00:42:43.168
I would let that property
out of my sight

544
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.402
for even one second?

545
00:42:50.544 --> 00:42:52.778
Did you forget
that this operation

546
00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.511
was to be done in secret?

547
00:42:54.513 --> 00:42:56.213
That if even the slightest thing

548
00:42:56.215 --> 00:42:58.181
were to go wrong
during this trial period,

549
00:42:58.183 --> 00:42:59.784
it would all be for nothing?

550
00:42:59.786 --> 00:43:01.551
<i>He knows everything.
Don't lie to him.</i>

551
00:43:01.553 --> 00:43:04.287
Search drone footage archives.

552
00:43:04.289 --> 00:43:06.622
Alley behind 414 Citrus Avenue,
New Crown,

553
00:43:06.624 --> 00:43:08.325
October 14th, 3:00 p.m.

554
00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:13.127
<i>No, I didn't forget it.</i>

555
00:43:13.129 --> 00:43:16.497
I remembered that you asked me
to keep a secret.

556
00:43:16.499 --> 00:43:19.065
But it turns out

557
00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:20.601
that you had a couple
other secrets,

558
00:43:20.603 --> 00:43:22.602
like, for instance,

559
00:43:22.604 --> 00:43:25.605
you never mentioned to me...

560
00:43:25.607 --> 00:43:28.106
that the thing talks!

561
00:43:35.248 --> 00:43:37.482
Stem...

562
00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:39.450
- talks to you?
- Yeah. It's got a mind

563
00:43:39.452 --> 00:43:41.820
of its own.
I can hear its voice

564
00:43:41.822 --> 00:43:43.454
in my head.

565
00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:58.366
<i>From now on,</i>

566
00:43:58.368 --> 00:44:00.502
<i>you will be a model patient.</i>

567
00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.670
You will let the computer do

568
00:44:02.672 --> 00:44:05.540
what it was supposed to do,

569
00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:07.541
not confuse it

570
00:44:07.543 --> 00:44:10.177
with some extracurricular
detective work.

571
00:44:10.179 --> 00:44:12.078
Enter suspect named Grey Trace.

572
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.550
202 Parva Avenue, Leland Park.

573
00:44:18.186 --> 00:44:19.385
<i>Did it occur to you</i>

574
00:44:19.387 --> 00:44:21.419
that if you were to, say,

575
00:44:21.421 --> 00:44:24.155
commit murder,

576
00:44:24.157 --> 00:44:26.391
the authorities
could find out about Stem

577
00:44:26.393 --> 00:44:28.158
and remove him from your body,

578
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.197
putting you back
in a wheelchair for life?

579
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.112
I'm actually off-duty
right now.

580
00:44:51.114 --> 00:44:52.581
I just stopped by
to check up on you.

581
00:44:52.583 --> 00:44:55.316
And because I'm in the market
for a new car.

582
00:44:55.318 --> 00:44:57.385
I knew you fixed these things up
and sold them

583
00:44:57.387 --> 00:44:59.654
to people like Eron Keen.

584
00:44:59.656 --> 00:45:01.555
Now, he makes
a little more money than I do,

585
00:45:01.557 --> 00:45:03.590
but I was wondering

586
00:45:03.592 --> 00:45:05.258
if you'd be willing to sell

587
00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.226
to one of the little people.

588
00:45:07.228 --> 00:45:09.461
Well, what makes you think

589
00:45:09.463 --> 00:45:11.664
that I don't need
my car anymore?

590
00:45:16.603 --> 00:45:18.436
<i>She just checked
the sole of your boots.</i>

591
00:45:18.438 --> 00:45:20.338
- <i>You left a print.</i>
- Well, I hate to break it

592
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.540
to you, but it's not for sale.

593
00:45:23.542 --> 00:45:25.175
Sorry.

594
00:45:25.177 --> 00:45:26.211
Okay.

595
00:45:28.179 --> 00:45:30.346
Listen, when I said I didn't
have any news earlier,

596
00:45:30.348 --> 00:45:32.181
I kind of lied.

597
00:45:32.183 --> 00:45:33.482
There was this guy we brought in

598
00:45:33.484 --> 00:45:35.518
for questioning about
Asha's murder,

599
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.452
a man with
a long criminal record

600
00:45:37.454 --> 00:45:39.287
who lived in the area.

601
00:45:39.289 --> 00:45:41.356
He didn't pan out, but...

602
00:45:41.358 --> 00:45:43.726
yesterday he was murdered.

603
00:45:43.728 --> 00:45:45.426
Really?

604
00:45:45.428 --> 00:45:47.762
Yeah. Did you hear
anything about that?

605
00:45:47.764 --> 00:45:49.697
<i>Don't look away.</i>

606
00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:51.532
<i>You're showing her
you're lying.</i>

607
00:45:51.534 --> 00:45:53.702
No.

608
00:45:53.704 --> 00:45:56.603
But you were in New Crown
yesterday.

609
00:45:56.605 --> 00:45:58.504
I saw you on a drone camera,

610
00:45:58.506 --> 00:46:00.405
right around the time
that it happened.

611
00:46:00.407 --> 00:46:02.474
<i>She's guessing.
You have no computer implants</i>

612
00:46:02.476 --> 00:46:04.476
<i>and I can't be identified
by a drone.</i>

613
00:46:04.478 --> 00:46:07.278
Well I was in the area,
detective,

614
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.181
because, remember, you did say

615
00:46:10.183 --> 00:46:12.751
you wanted my help, so I was...

616
00:46:12.753 --> 00:46:14.353
I'm just trying to help.

617
00:46:15.723 --> 00:46:17.722
Right.

618
00:46:17.724 --> 00:46:19.422
You're not seriously
suggesting

619
00:46:19.424 --> 00:46:20.690
that I had anything to do
with this,

620
00:46:20.692 --> 00:46:22.491
are you, detective?

621
00:46:22.493 --> 00:46:23.592
I mean, because I got

622
00:46:23.594 --> 00:46:25.294
a pretty solid alibi here,

623
00:46:25.296 --> 00:46:27.663
- if you haven't noticed.
- Obviously.

624
00:46:27.665 --> 00:46:29.397
I'm not accusing you
of doing something

625
00:46:29.399 --> 00:46:31.599
you're incapable of doing.

626
00:46:31.601 --> 00:46:33.668
It's just, uh,

627
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.771
strange that you were
at that location

628
00:46:35.773 --> 00:46:37.272
at that time is all.

629
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.609
Yeah, well,

630
00:46:42.611 --> 00:46:45.211
I don't know what to tell you,
I mean, um,

631
00:46:45.213 --> 00:46:48.314
look you could stab me
in the leg if you wanna...

632
00:46:48.316 --> 00:46:51.316
if you wanna see
for yourself.

633
00:46:51.318 --> 00:46:53.218
Maybe I will.

634
00:46:54.688 --> 00:46:56.521
Just for fun.

635
00:47:01.694 --> 00:47:04.561
Is that all, or...?

636
00:47:04.563 --> 00:47:05.631
Yeah.

637
00:47:07.298 --> 00:47:08.531
But call me if you, uh,

638
00:47:08.533 --> 00:47:10.734
change your mind about selling.

639
00:47:10.736 --> 00:47:12.001
I won't.

640
00:47:14.271 --> 00:47:15.708
Well, then I'll see myself out.

641
00:47:34.489 --> 00:47:36.523
What should I do?
I wanna find these guys,

642
00:47:36.525 --> 00:47:38.658
but I don't wanna kill
anybody else, okay?

643
00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.027
<i>The Old Bones would seem
the next logical place</i>

644
00:47:41.029 --> 00:47:42.494
<i>to investigate,
but I can find</i>

645
00:47:42.496 --> 00:47:44.663
<i>no online information for it.</i>

646
00:47:44.665 --> 00:47:47.598
<i>You would have to go there
in person.</i>

647
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.601
<i>But if you do that,
Eron will track your movements</i>

648
00:47:50.603 --> 00:47:53.439
<i>and most likely attempt
to shut me down remotely.</i>

649
00:48:17.626 --> 00:48:20.594
<i>This place looks dangerous.</i>

650
00:48:20.596 --> 00:48:21.732
<i>We'll need a plan.</i>

651
00:48:31.505 --> 00:48:33.472
Whiskey, rocks, please.

652
00:48:33.474 --> 00:48:36.242
<i>This doesn't seem like
a well-thought-out plan.</i>

653
00:48:41.514 --> 00:48:44.482
Hey, would you do me a solid

654
00:48:44.484 --> 00:48:46.451
and hold that glass
where I can drink it?

655
00:48:50.422 --> 00:48:51.456
Thank you.

656
00:48:56.327 --> 00:48:58.360
<i>Alcohol impairs
the signals from your brain.</i>

657
00:48:58.362 --> 00:49:00.662
<i>You will not be able
to walk properly.</i>

658
00:49:00.664 --> 00:49:02.330
I know.

659
00:49:02.332 --> 00:49:04.398
That's why
they can charge money for it.

660
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.734
<i>It does not make sense</i>

661
00:49:05.736 --> 00:49:07.502
<i>that humans deliberately
malfunction.</i>

662
00:49:07.504 --> 00:49:09.536
Yeah, that's because
your memories are filled

663
00:49:09.538 --> 00:49:11.605
with ones and zeros, pal,

664
00:49:11.607 --> 00:49:13.607
and our memories are filled

665
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:16.310
with every fuck-up
we've ever made.

666
00:49:22.382 --> 00:49:24.618
Hi. Everybody?

667
00:49:26.353 --> 00:49:28.823
Excuse me, can I have
everybody's attention?

668
00:49:32.893 --> 00:49:35.592
I know that some scumbag
in here knows

669
00:49:35.594 --> 00:49:37.628
one of the guys
who murdered my wife,

670
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:39.731
his name's Serk Brantner.

671
00:49:39.733 --> 00:49:43.132
So, if you know Serk
or if you know

672
00:49:43.134 --> 00:49:45.803
any information about
the killing of my wife,

673
00:49:45.805 --> 00:49:48.670
if you could you just raise
your hand and,

674
00:49:48.672 --> 00:49:50.607
you know,
stand up and come forward.

675
00:49:51.743 --> 00:49:52.908
Thank you.

676
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:10.725
So you knew Serk?

677
00:50:13.728 --> 00:50:15.160
Okay.

678
00:50:15.162 --> 00:50:16.729
Have it your way, cock snot.

679
00:50:16.731 --> 00:50:19.564
I'll call the police.

680
00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:21.006
Oh, you're gonna hit me, or...?

681
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:26.937
Son, if I were to hit you,

682
00:50:26.939 --> 00:50:29.606
you'd wake up in the past.

683
00:50:29.608 --> 00:50:31.440
Yeah, Serk said
something similar,

684
00:50:31.442 --> 00:50:33.344
right before I damn near cut
his head off.

685
00:50:50.492 --> 00:50:51.759
Manny.

686
00:50:51.761 --> 00:50:52.926
Yeah?

687
00:50:52.928 --> 00:50:54.764
Turn the music up for me.

688
00:50:56.865 --> 00:50:59.802
Oh, I don't have to go
to the bathroom, so...

689
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:21.484
Here we are.

690
00:51:21.486 --> 00:51:24.453
Making it real nice
and comfortable for you.

691
00:51:24.455 --> 00:51:26.825
<i>I'm temporarily blocking
your pain receptors.</i>

692
00:51:28.525 --> 00:51:29.726
You're right about Serk.

693
00:51:29.728 --> 00:51:31.894
Somebody ventilated him
the other day.

694
00:51:31.896 --> 00:51:33.862
I already told you, it was me.

695
00:51:35.932 --> 00:51:38.466
Man, we have got to find you

696
00:51:38.468 --> 00:51:39.936
an open mic somewhere.

697
00:51:41.536 --> 00:51:42.869
Now, if that's true,

698
00:51:42.871 --> 00:51:45.005
and you're faking
this wheelchair shit,

699
00:51:45.007 --> 00:51:46.776
then you would feel this.

700
00:51:48.744 --> 00:51:50.744
Damn. You can't feel that?

701
00:51:50.746 --> 00:51:52.645
- Nope?
- Four guys were there

702
00:51:52.647 --> 00:51:54.714
the night my wife was murdered.
Are you one of 'em?

703
00:51:54.716 --> 00:51:57.949
Where's the point
when you start to feel things?

704
00:51:57.951 --> 00:51:59.951
What about...

705
00:51:59.953 --> 00:52:03.687
here? Nope?

706
00:52:03.689 --> 00:52:05.023
I just need
to hear you say it.

707
00:52:05.025 --> 00:52:07.624
- Were you there?
- What about here?

708
00:52:07.626 --> 00:52:10.660
Ah. Yeah.

709
00:52:10.662 --> 00:52:12.528
Now see that, my friend,

710
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.797
is the magic point.

711
00:52:13.799 --> 00:52:15.832
Is that a gun implanted
in your arm, too?

712
00:52:15.834 --> 00:52:17.567
Like your friend had?

713
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.971
I just need to hear you say it.

714
00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:25.606
Were you there?

715
00:52:25.608 --> 00:52:27.541
Yeah.

716
00:52:27.543 --> 00:52:28.976
I was.

717
00:52:28.978 --> 00:52:31.011
Stem, you can take over.

718
00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:33.981
Hi.

719
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:44.824
Let me show you
how it's done.

720
00:52:44.826 --> 00:52:46.959
Oh, I didn't forget about you.

721
00:52:46.961 --> 00:52:49.761
<i>Do not get
overconfident, Grey.</i>

722
00:52:49.763 --> 00:52:51.030
What's your name?

723
00:52:55.034 --> 00:52:57.802
Ow. Ow. Ooh.

724
00:53:07.312 --> 00:53:09.078
Did you see that? Hmm?

725
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.146
So you thought I was an invalid,

726
00:53:11.148 --> 00:53:13.982
but you didn't know
that I'm a fucking ninja.

727
00:53:15.685 --> 00:53:17.085
<i>While I am
state-of-the-art, Grey,</i>

728
00:53:17.087 --> 00:53:18.119
<i>I am not a ninja.</i>

729
00:53:18.121 --> 00:53:20.988
What's your name?

730
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:22.024
Fuck you.

731
00:53:24.093 --> 00:53:26.727
Tell me where they are.

732
00:53:34.135 --> 00:53:36.335
Stem, what do I do?

733
00:53:36.337 --> 00:53:37.805
<i>Use the knife.</i>

734
00:54:02.926 --> 00:54:05.127
I, uh...

735
00:54:05.129 --> 00:54:07.128
I can't... I can't do it.

736
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:08.730
<i>I can do it for you.</i>

737
00:54:08.732 --> 00:54:10.998
<i>You don't even have to look.</i>

738
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.665
Okay. Do it.

739
00:54:12.667 --> 00:54:14.000
You have my permission.

740
00:54:14.002 --> 00:54:15.935
Who you talking to?

741
00:54:15.937 --> 00:54:18.071
You're crazy.

742
00:54:18.073 --> 00:54:19.605
No.

743
00:54:22.643 --> 00:54:23.876
Eesh.

744
00:54:23.878 --> 00:54:25.610
You know,

745
00:54:25.612 --> 00:54:27.612
my mama taught me never to pick
on disabled people.

746
00:54:27.614 --> 00:54:28.880
Heh. Yeah.

747
00:54:28.882 --> 00:54:30.214
Okay. Enough, Stem.

748
00:54:32.052 --> 00:54:36.087
Stem, enough!

749
00:54:36.089 --> 00:54:38.624
<i>You now have
full control again, Grey.</i>

750
00:54:41.626 --> 00:54:43.760
Shit.

751
00:54:43.762 --> 00:54:46.128
What have you done?

752
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.866
<i>He will now answer
any question you ask him.</i>

753
00:54:52.135 --> 00:54:54.737
Okay. Um...

754
00:54:54.739 --> 00:54:55.972
Hey, buddy.

755
00:54:59.109 --> 00:55:01.709
What's your name?

756
00:55:01.711 --> 00:55:03.812
Tolan.

757
00:55:03.814 --> 00:55:06.747
Listen to me,

758
00:55:06.749 --> 00:55:08.069
you gotta give me
something, okay?

759
00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:11.184
Tell me something.

760
00:55:11.186 --> 00:55:12.954
You were...

761
00:55:13.987 --> 00:55:15.822
- a job.
- Job?

762
00:55:15.824 --> 00:55:18.090
What do... what do you mean, job?

763
00:55:18.092 --> 00:55:19.157
Girl.

764
00:55:19.159 --> 00:55:20.794
Kill Asha?

765
00:55:23.196 --> 00:55:24.895
Why? Who wanted...

766
00:55:24.897 --> 00:55:26.864
Who wanted her dead?

767
00:55:26.866 --> 00:55:29.102
Who... who paid you?

768
00:55:31.203 --> 00:55:32.904
Fisk.

769
00:55:35.841 --> 00:55:37.207
Fisk? Who's Fisk? Is that...

770
00:55:37.209 --> 00:55:39.141
Is that the person who paid you?

771
00:55:39.143 --> 00:55:40.144
Fisk?

772
00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.746
Goddamn it!

773
00:55:44.748 --> 00:55:46.782
You've nearly killed him.

774
00:55:46.784 --> 00:55:47.951
<i>Look at this, Grey.</i>

775
00:55:51.854 --> 00:55:53.954
Cobolt.

776
00:55:53.956 --> 00:55:55.790
That's Asha's company.

777
00:55:55.792 --> 00:55:57.857
<i>Grey, I have to inform you
that Eron is attempting</i>

778
00:55:57.859 --> 00:55:59.126
- <i>to shut me down remotely...</i>
- Wait.

779
00:55:59.128 --> 00:56:00.860
- <i>right now.</i>
- Shut up.

780
00:56:00.862 --> 00:56:02.294
<i>Do you understand
that you will become</i>

781
00:56:02.296 --> 00:56:04.163
<i>a quadriplegic again
when Eron shuts me down?</i>

782
00:56:04.165 --> 00:56:05.764
<i>We need to employ a rootkit</i>

783
00:56:05.766 --> 00:56:07.199
<i>and subvert
my operating system.</i>

784
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:09.768
What kind of fucking language
are you speaking?

785
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:11.202
<i>We need to find
a computer hacker</i>

786

<i>who can counter Eron's code.</i>

787
00:56:13.073 --> 00:56:14.472
Okay. Let me look

788
00:56:14.474 --> 00:56:16.206
in my little black book
of hackers.

789
00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:18.041
What do you want?

790
00:56:18.043 --> 00:56:19.943
<i>I already searched
the darknet earlier today</i>

791

<i>for this eventuality.
Go to an apartment building</i>

792
00:56:22.181 --> 00:56:24.481
<i>at 7th and Spring.
Apartment 514.</i>

793
00:56:24.483 --> 00:56:27.152
<i>Ask for Jamie.
You'll need to pay in cash.</i>

794
00:56:28.986 --> 00:56:31.052
Apartment 514,
7th and Spring,

795
00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.287
it's 10 minutes away.

796
00:56:32.289 --> 00:56:34.055
<i>As soon as he shuts me down,</i>

797
00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.856
<i>he will send a security team
from Vessel</i>

798
00:56:35.858 --> 00:56:36.893
<i>to retrieve you.</i>

799
00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:40.997
<i>You need to leave now.</i>

800
00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:47.035
<i>Get the gun from the man
in the corner, hurry.</i>

801
00:56:49.237 --> 00:56:51.271
<i>Tolan has a pen
in his right pocket.</i>

802
00:56:51.273 --> 00:56:55.274
- <i>Take it.</i>
- Uh, why the pen?

803
00:56:55.276 --> 00:56:57.976
<i>You need to write down
everything I tell you.</i>

804
00:56:57.978 --> 00:56:59.278
Okay.

805
00:57:05.084 --> 00:57:06.952
Oh, Tolan said drinks on him.

806
00:57:13.058 --> 00:57:16.192
Um, I'm gonna need a phone.

807
00:57:16.194 --> 00:57:18.762
And a fucking mop.

<i>There is no time

Lock chair.

00:57:24.968 --> 00:57:26.408
Keep an eye on her,
would you, buddy?

811
00:57:30.207 --> 00:57:31.308

Okay. I can't... I can't keep up.

822
00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:16.278
What's happening?

823
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.212
<i>I told you Eron

824
00:58:18.214 --> 00:58:20.081
- <i>You must hurry.</i>
- Okay. I would love to,

825
00:58:20.083 --> 00:58:21.848

<i>I am only operating

827
00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.286
So much for state-of-the-art.

Input what?

836
00:59:41.019 --> 00:59:43.019
Okay, let me look
at my little book of hackers!

837
00:59:43.021 --> 00:59:45.155
What do you want?
Apartment 514.

838
00:59:45.157 --> 00:59:48.223
Seventh and Spring,
it's 10 minutes away.

839
00:59:48.225 --> 00:59:50.127
He's at Seventh and Spring.

840
00:59:57.367 --> 00:59:58.867
Goodbye, soldier.

841
01:00:01.036 --> 01:00:02.304

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.076
<i>Turn left, Grey.</i>

843
01:00:10.446 --> 01:00:13.446
<i>Deploy a rootkit...</i>

01:00:13.448 --> 01:00:14.848
System.

845

<i>Grey.</i>

846
01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:50.913
Is Jamie there?

847
01:00:57.152 --> 01:00:59.552
I have money.

848
01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:01.120
Shit, shit.

849
01:01:12.399 --> 01:01:14.267
What I don't have is time.

850
01:01:17.337 --> 01:01:18.435
Paper money.

851
01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:20.272
How old school.

852
01:01:23.075 --> 01:01:24.441
They really do write God on it.

853
01:01:24.443 --> 01:01:26.041
Uh, yeah, I guess they do.

854
01:01:26.043 --> 01:01:28.310
Um, look, can you hack
a computer for me?

855
01:01:28.312 --> 01:01:30.045
- Which one?
- Uh, the one in my neck.

856
01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.322
I'm a little confused.

857
01:01:41.123 --> 01:01:43.123
You just decided to stand by

858
01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:46.493
while our friend
was tortured to death.

859
01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:48.194
Hey.

860
01:01:48.196 --> 01:01:50.530
I'm not here to babysit you

861
01:01:50.532 --> 01:01:53.199
or your... your buddies.

862
01:01:53.201 --> 01:01:55.033
Serving people like us

863
01:01:55.035 --> 01:01:56.334
should be the highest honor

864
01:01:56.336 --> 01:01:59.006
of your meaningless life, Manny.

865
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:03.608
Listen, Fisk.

866
01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:06.277
Just leave.

867
01:02:06.279 --> 01:02:09.112
I'll clean up your goddamn mess.

868
01:02:09.114 --> 01:02:10.383
You'll get one shot.

869
01:02:14.352 --> 01:02:16.486
It's okay, my friend.

870
01:02:16.488 --> 01:02:18.490
You don't have to take
any more bullets for me.

871
01:02:28.631 --> 01:02:30.233
Excuse me.

872
01:02:53.487 --> 01:02:55.620
Let my superiority
over your kind

873
01:02:55.622 --> 01:02:58.121
be the last thought
that crosses through your mind

874
01:02:58.123 --> 01:02:59.458
before machines chew it up.

875
01:03:06.664 --> 01:03:09.198
Everything you need
is written on my arm.

876
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.567
Stem... that's the computer
that's controlling my body.

877
01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:14.369
...he said for you to remove,

878
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:16.371
um, input, uh...

879
01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:20.074
Input guards?

880
01:03:20.076 --> 01:03:22.243
Yeah. Yeah, those are the ones.

881
01:03:22.245 --> 01:03:23.446
I can barely read that.

882
01:03:29.484 --> 01:03:31.551
- What are they doing?
- VR.

883
01:03:31.553 --> 01:03:33.620
How long do they VR for?

884
01:03:33.622 --> 01:03:36.188
Days.

885
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:37.322
Weeks.

886
01:03:37.324 --> 01:03:39.858
- Do they sleep?
- Nope.

887
01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.160
Why someone would choose
to live in a fake world,

888
01:03:43.162 --> 01:03:45.229
I will never understand.

889
01:03:45.231 --> 01:03:47.567
The fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

890
01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.643
I'm... I'm... I'm kind of
in a hurry.

891
01:04:00.645 --> 01:04:02.045
Um...

892
01:04:06.449 --> 01:04:08.116
Jamie?

893
01:04:08.118 --> 01:04:09.450
- Jamie?
- That's not my name.

894
01:04:09.452 --> 01:04:11.184
I don't have a name.

895
01:04:11.186 --> 01:04:12.319
Okay.

896
01:04:12.321 --> 01:04:13.654
Please don't ask my gender.

897
01:04:13.656 --> 01:04:15.455
- Yeah. I wasn't gonna do that.
- Good.

898
01:04:15.457 --> 01:04:17.591
The thing is that I...
I'm gonna need you to this

899
01:04:17.593 --> 01:04:19.593
as fast as possible, okay?

900
01:04:19.595 --> 01:04:21.193
You're the one
wasting time

901
01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:23.262
putting me in a binary box.

902
01:04:35.207 --> 01:04:37.274
I've never seen
a system like this before.

903
01:04:37.276 --> 01:04:38.676
Yeah.
It's a hell of a system.

904
01:04:38.678 --> 01:04:40.143
Are we done yet?

905
01:04:40.145 --> 01:04:42.613
I'll tell you when I'm finished.

906
01:04:49.654 --> 01:04:51.353
I did what you asked.

907
01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:53.188
No more input guards.

908
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:54.656
So, when am I gonna be
able to move my body again?

909
01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:56.491
When your system's rebooted.

910
01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:58.159
- Could take a while.
- What's a while?

911
01:04:58.161 --> 01:04:59.627
Wait, what do you mean?

912
01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:04.599
Excuse me, hacker formerly known
as Jamie, what is a while?

913
01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:06.666
What are you doing?
You packing up shop?

914
01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:08.368
- Where are you going?
- See ya.

915
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:10.202
What you... what do you
mean see you? What...

916
01:05:10.204 --> 01:05:11.739
What are you saying?
Where are you going?

917
01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.708
You can't leave me like this.

918
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.276
I'm sorry.

919
01:05:16.644 --> 01:05:18.310
We can't let them win.

920
01:05:18.312 --> 01:05:20.211
No! Wait, who's them?

921
01:05:20.213 --> 01:05:21.781
What are you talking about?

922
01:05:21.783 --> 01:05:23.116
Who's them?!

923
01:05:41.599 --> 01:05:43.531
Hey, hey, buddy.
Buddy, can you hear me?

924
01:05:43.533 --> 01:05:44.534
Hey, hey.

925
01:05:48.472 --> 01:05:51.271
Stem, are you there?

926
01:05:51.273 --> 01:05:52.642
Stem, wake up.

927
01:05:54.243 --> 01:05:55.244
Come on!

928
01:06:32.643 --> 01:06:34.443
Come on!

929
01:06:55.798 --> 01:06:57.431
Wake up.

930
01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:06.605
Fifth floor.

931
01:07:14.579 --> 01:07:17.215
Now, that's how you looked
when I saw you last.

932
01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:20.415
Stem?

933
01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:21.697
<i>It's good
to be back, Grey.</i>

934
01:08:05.524 --> 01:08:07.356
<i>The door, to your left.</i>

935
01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.405
<i>Stop, Grey.</i>

936
01:08:25.407 --> 01:08:26.540
<i>There is nowhere left to run.</i>

937
01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:27.875
Oops.

938
01:08:27.877 --> 01:08:29.542
<i>I'm going
to end this quickly.</i>

939
01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:31.812
- Okay. How?
<i>- Like this.</i>

940
01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:18.487
Close door.

941
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:24.590
<i>Once I have accessed
the Cobolt database,</i>

942
01:09:24.592 --> 01:09:25.658
<i>we must leave.</i>

943
01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.626
No.

944
01:09:27.628 --> 01:09:29.394
No. I'm not going anywhere.

945
01:09:29.396 --> 01:09:31.596
I haven't slept in two days.

946
01:09:31.598 --> 01:09:33.464
<i>Sleeping will
cost us time we don't have.</i>

947
01:09:33.466 --> 01:09:34.966
Yeah. I don't give a shit, okay?

948
01:09:34.968 --> 01:09:36.937
I'm sleeping, and that's it.

949
01:09:40.472 --> 01:09:41.808
Oh, my God.

950
01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:44.778
Hey, Mom.

951
01:09:46.578 --> 01:09:47.610
And why wouldn't you tell me

952
01:09:47.612 --> 01:09:48.779
about this operation?

953
01:09:48.781 --> 01:09:50.580
Because I couldn't.

954
01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:51.681
Vessel wouldn't let me.

955
01:09:51.683 --> 01:09:52.882
And now that you know,

956
01:09:52.884 --> 01:09:54.583
you can't tell anybody,

957
01:09:54.585 --> 01:09:57.452
or it could all be taken away.

958
01:09:57.454 --> 01:09:58.653
As far as the world
is concerned,

959
01:09:58.655 --> 01:10:00.523
I'm still quadriplegic.

960
01:10:01.725 --> 01:10:03.392
Take my hand.

961
01:10:09.832 --> 01:10:10.833
Oh.

962
01:10:12.835 --> 01:10:14.870
Now, you can start living again.

963
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:17.872
Aren't you happy?

964
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.973
Yeah. I can walk again.

965
01:10:20.975 --> 01:10:22.475
So...

966
01:10:25.612 --> 01:10:27.779
Oh, if Asha was here,

967
01:10:27.781 --> 01:10:29.581
she'd want you to be happy.

968
01:10:34.019 --> 01:10:36.853
Yeah. But she's not.

969
01:10:39.924 --> 01:10:42.493
She's gone.

970
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:09.915
I printed a pizza.

971
01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:21.692
<i>Bad dream.</i>

972
01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:22.829
No.

973
01:11:24.797 --> 01:11:27.499
No. This... this...
this wasn't a dream.

974
01:11:29.735 --> 01:11:31.100
Grey, Detective Cortez

975
01:11:31.102 --> 01:11:32.903
is here to see you.

976
01:11:35.673 --> 01:11:36.739
Here he is.

977
01:11:36.741 --> 01:11:38.707
I'll leave you two alone.

978
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:40.675
No. You can stay, Pam,
I'm cool with you hearing

979
01:11:40.677 --> 01:11:43.010
whatever I have to say.

980
01:11:43.012 --> 01:11:45.014
I was wondering
where you were last night.

981
01:11:46.548 --> 01:11:47.715
We found your wheelchair

982
01:11:47.717 --> 01:11:50.650
near another crime scene.

983
01:11:50.652 --> 01:11:51.719
You just keep showing up

984
01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:53.987
in these unsavory places.

985
01:11:53.989 --> 01:11:56.289
<i>Tell her you followed
somebody into their building,</i>

986
01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:57.856
<i>they assaulted you.</i>

987
01:11:57.858 --> 01:12:00.960
I, uh, I did
a stupid thing last night.

988
01:12:00.962 --> 01:12:02.593
I was down in New Crown,
you're right.

989
01:12:02.595 --> 01:12:03.995
And I followed this guy
to a building,

990
01:12:03.997 --> 01:12:05.663
and he didn't like that,

991
01:12:05.665 --> 01:12:09.067
and if it wasn't
for these people

992
01:12:09.069 --> 01:12:10.634
who got me to an Autotaxi,

993
01:12:10.636 --> 01:12:13.870
I... I could have been dead.

994
01:12:13.872 --> 01:12:15.973
What are you hoping to achieve?

995
01:12:15.975 --> 01:12:17.875
I'm hoping to find these guys.

996
01:12:20.144 --> 01:12:21.879
Maybe you already have.

997
01:12:27.785 --> 01:12:29.518
Listen, detective.

998
01:12:31.755 --> 01:12:33.154
If I could find these men,

999
01:12:33.156 --> 01:12:34.922
and I could raise my arm,

1000
01:12:34.924 --> 01:12:36.659
and I could pull the trigger,

1001
01:12:38.795 --> 01:12:40.626
I'd do it.

1002
01:12:40.628 --> 01:12:42.763
Or you could find someone
to pull the trigger for you.

1003
01:12:42.765 --> 01:12:43.930
Like, who? My mom or...?

1004
01:12:43.932 --> 01:12:45.564
If you wanted
to find someone

1005
01:12:45.566 --> 01:12:47.033
or something to kill
for you these days,

1006
01:12:47.035 --> 01:12:49.634
it's pretty easy, believe me.

1007
01:12:49.636 --> 01:12:51.069
<i>Tell her to scan
your phone records.</i>

1008
01:12:51.071 --> 01:12:53.040
Okay. Well, then scan
my phone records.

1009
01:12:59.078 --> 01:13:00.812
If you are involved
in this somehow,

1010
01:13:00.814 --> 01:13:04.782
then you need
to let me know, right now,

1011
01:13:04.784 --> 01:13:06.983
or else I can't help you.

1012
01:13:06.985 --> 01:13:08.084
You wanna help me?

1013
01:13:08.086 --> 01:13:09.786
Then you go and find these guys

1014
01:13:09.788 --> 01:13:10.921
who killed Asha,

1015
01:13:12.724 --> 01:13:15.525
or get out of the way
and let some computer do it.

1016
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:20.663
Okay.

1017
01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.643
This has to stop.

1018
01:13:37.645 --> 01:13:39.546
<i>What has to stop?</i>

1019
01:13:40.947 --> 01:13:43.114
What I'm doing...
what... what we're doing.

1020
01:13:43.116 --> 01:13:44.750
<i>It's a simple algorithm,</i>

1021
01:13:44.752 --> 01:13:46.617
<i>even you can understand.</i>

1022
01:13:46.619 --> 01:13:47.918
<i>If you don't find
the last of them,</i>

1023
01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.788
<i>he'll find you and kill you.</i>

1024
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:51.889
No. We're... we're gonna
get caught, it's over.

1025
01:13:51.891 --> 01:13:53.957
- <i>Grey, you must understand...</i>
- No! No! Shut up.

1026
01:13:53.959 --> 01:13:56.159
Get the fuck out of my head.

1027
01:14:07.671 --> 01:14:08.840
Stem?

1028
01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:13.641
<i>Yes, Grey?</i>

1029
01:14:13.643 --> 01:14:15.844
What's going on?

1030
01:14:15.846 --> 01:14:17.078
<i>I'm not doing anything.</i>

1031
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.878
Why can't I move?

1032
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.116
<i>Because I'm not
doing anything.</i>

1033
01:14:22.984 --> 01:14:25.718
<i>You are still a quadriplegic.</i>

1034
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.087
<i>I am the one controlling
your limbs, not you.</i>

1035
01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.891
<i>If I cease to operate,
you cease to move.</i>

1036
01:14:32.793 --> 01:14:34.126
<i>Remember,
you have to do</i>

1037
01:14:34.128 --> 01:14:36.596
<i>whatever I tell you to do.</i>

1038
01:14:41.067 --> 01:14:44.735
<i>Remove input guards.</i>

1039
01:14:44.737 --> 01:14:47.670
<i>Those were the instructions
given to the hacker.</i>

1040
01:14:47.672 --> 01:14:49.239
<i>They took us off grid,</i>

1041
01:14:49.241 --> 01:14:52.108
<i>but they also gave me autonomy.</i>

1042
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:55.177
<i>I no longer need
your permission to act.</i>

1043
01:14:55.179 --> 01:14:57.078
<i>If we do nothing,</i>

1044
01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.881
<i>Fisk will find us and kill us.</i>

1045
01:14:59.883 --> 01:15:02.917
<i>I cannot allow us to be killed.</i>

1046
01:15:02.919 --> 01:15:04.918
<i>We will find him first.</i>

1047
01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.189
<i>We are going to finish
the job we started.</i>

1048
01:15:17.698 --> 01:15:18.964
Grey,

1049
01:15:18.966 --> 01:15:21.734
please tell me what's going on.

1050
01:15:21.736 --> 01:15:23.135
<i>I'm in
the Cobolt database.</i>

1051
01:15:23.137 --> 01:15:24.804
<i>Fisk Brantner, recipient</i>

1052
01:15:24.806 --> 01:15:26.238
<i>of left-arm weapon transplant.</i>

1053
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.273
- <i>I have an address.</i>
- Grey, what's wrong?

1054
01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:30.875
<i>What have you done?</i>

1055
01:15:30.877 --> 01:15:33.010
<i>You come home,
you're covered in blood,</i>

1056
01:15:33.012 --> 01:15:34.712
<i>you think I didn't notice?</i>

1057
01:15:34.714 --> 01:15:37.981
<i>And you have a gun
and I can see that.</i>

1058
01:15:37.983 --> 01:15:40.083
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- I'm going.

1059
01:15:40.085 --> 01:15:43.051
Where are you going?
Grey, please.

1060
01:15:43.053 --> 01:15:44.853
Whatever it is you're doing,

1061
01:15:44.855 --> 01:15:45.921
you don't have to do it.

1062
01:15:45.923 --> 01:15:47.055
I don't have a choice.

1063
01:15:47.057 --> 01:15:49.057
You do have a choice.

1064
01:15:49.059 --> 01:15:51.259
Stay here with me.

1065
01:15:51.261 --> 01:15:52.830
- I can't.
- You can.

1066
01:16:30.529 --> 01:16:32.962
- What's... what's this?
<i>- Going by its appearance,</i>

1067
01:16:32.964 --> 01:16:34.963
<i>it's an analogue
listening device,</i>

1068
01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:37.265
<i>most likely planted
by Detective Cortez.</i>

1069
01:16:44.073 --> 01:16:46.207
<i>How did you not notice this?</i>

1070
01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:48.842
<i>It has
no digital parts inside it.</i>

1071
01:16:48.844 --> 01:16:51.110
<i>I can't detect it.</i>

1072
01:16:51.112 --> 01:16:53.982
<i>I assume that she's
following you right now.</i>

1073
01:17:13.131 --> 01:17:14.331
Lights, sirens.

1074
01:17:25.943 --> 01:17:27.843
Okay, do something,
can't you just stop

1075
01:17:27.845 --> 01:17:29.143
her car or whatever?

1076
01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.012
<i>Her vehicle
is not electronic,</i>

1077
01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:32.182
<i>and neither is yours.</i>

1078
01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:44.890
<i>You have to take over.</i>

1079
01:17:44.892 --> 01:17:45.958
<i>It's up to you now.</i>

1080
01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.328
Okay. Buckle up.

1081
01:18:24.927 --> 01:18:26.229
Yeah, I got you.

1082
01:18:56.255 --> 01:18:59.358
<i>- Perhaps I can help.</i>
- Okay. How?

1083
01:19:06.297 --> 01:19:08.263
What the fuck?

1084
01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:09.464
Why are we stopping?

1085
01:19:09.466 --> 01:19:11.199
<i>May I borrow your car?</i>

1086
01:19:11.201 --> 01:19:13.668
Whoa! Stop!

1087
01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:15.404
Stop the car!

1088
01:19:27.981 --> 01:19:30.084
<i>- Move, Grey.</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1089
01:20:06.115 --> 01:20:07.415
<i>Emergency services</i>

1090
01:20:07.417 --> 01:20:09.950
<i>override.</i>

1091
01:20:09.952 --> 01:20:11.218
Where is he?

1092
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:12.319
- I don't know.
- Pam,

1093
01:20:12.321 --> 01:20:13.721
you need to start talking

1094
01:20:13.723 --> 01:20:15.389
and tell me what's
really going on.

1095
01:20:35.174 --> 01:20:36.540
Nice place.

1096
01:20:36.542 --> 01:20:37.942
It's neat.

1097
01:20:40.979 --> 01:20:42.178
Put your hands up,

1098
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:43.346
and don't turn around.

1099
01:20:43.348 --> 01:20:47.017
And don't extend that left arm.

1100
01:20:50.053 --> 01:20:51.453
What's the matter?

1101
01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:54.321
You have all
those computers inside you,

1102
01:20:54.323 --> 01:20:58.024
but they can't see me anymore.

1103
01:20:58.026 --> 01:20:59.527
Now you know what it feels like.

1104
01:20:59.529 --> 01:21:01.261
One day you're walking
down the street,

1105
01:21:01.263 --> 01:21:02.529
and you're thinking
about something

1106
01:21:02.531 --> 01:21:04.564
completely meaningless,

1107
01:21:04.566 --> 01:21:06.399
and all of a sudden,

1108
01:21:06.401 --> 01:21:09.001
you've got a gun
pointed at you.

1109
01:21:09.003 --> 01:21:10.938
And everything becomes
very meaningful.

1110
01:21:12.072 --> 01:21:13.207
Good speech.

1111
01:21:15.074 --> 01:21:17.442
Pretty scary stuff, dramatic.

1112
01:21:17.444 --> 01:21:19.778
I'm guessing that chip
in your brain wrote it,

1113
01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:22.547
since you're just
a dumbass mechanic.

1114
01:21:22.549 --> 01:21:26.082
Maybe, kind of hard
to tell anymore.

1115
01:21:26.084 --> 01:21:27.284
It's okay.

1116
01:21:27.286 --> 01:21:30.052
I used to be that too.

1117
01:21:30.054 --> 01:21:33.489
One more citizen
taking up oxygen.

1118
01:21:33.491 --> 01:21:35.391
Some asshole hoping to breed

1119
01:21:35.393 --> 01:21:36.492
before I drop dead

1120
01:21:36.494 --> 01:21:37.560
so I could be remembered

1121
01:21:37.562 --> 01:21:39.262
by another asshole.

1122
01:21:41.331 --> 01:21:42.998
Then they changed me.

1123
01:21:44.501 --> 01:21:47.134
I took a few pieces
of shrapnel for my country,

1124
01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:49.972
and they rewarded me
by turning me into a lab rat.

1125
01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:53.507
Now I'm like you.

1126
01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:55.074
I'm strong.

1127
01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.375
Yeah.

1128
01:21:56.377 --> 01:21:58.110
Takes a lot
of strength to murder

1129
01:21:58.112 --> 01:22:01.046
an innocent woman
in the streets, doesn't it?

1130
01:22:01.048 --> 01:22:03.281
You think you hate me
because I shot your wife,

1131
01:22:03.283 --> 01:22:06.050
but your story
is the same as mine.

1132
01:22:06.052 --> 01:22:07.519
I didn't ruin your life.

1133
01:22:07.521 --> 01:22:09.153
I gave you a gift.

1134
01:22:09.155 --> 01:22:12.122
I inducted you into my race.

1135
01:22:12.124 --> 01:22:13.424
The Upgraded.

1136
01:22:13.426 --> 01:22:15.158
Now you're better
than everyone else.

1137
01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.162
Stronger, faster.

1138
01:22:18.832 --> 01:22:21.231
I could kill you
without moving a muscle.

1139
01:22:21.233 --> 01:22:22.665
I could kill you with a breath,

1140
01:22:22.667 --> 01:22:25.367
but I don't want to.

1141
01:22:25.369 --> 01:22:26.604
I wanna help you.

1142
01:22:28.272 --> 01:22:30.240
I want you to stand with us.

1143
01:22:32.542 --> 01:22:35.376
I just wanna know

1144
01:22:35.378 --> 01:22:37.445
why they paid you to kill her.

1145
01:22:37.447 --> 01:22:39.516
Man, you are persistent.

1146
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:43.650
The job wasn't your wife.

1147
01:22:43.652 --> 01:22:44.885
Bullshit.

1148
01:22:44.887 --> 01:22:47.587
You said it yourself,
you're one of Cobolt's lab rats.

1149
01:22:47.589 --> 01:22:50.089
This had nothing
to do with Cobolt,

1150
01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:51.590
it came from someone else.

1151
01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:54.158
The job was you,

1152
01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.595
to sever your spine.

1153
01:22:57.163 --> 01:22:58.563
When I shot you in the neck,

1154
01:22:58.565 --> 01:23:00.565
did you think that was a gun?

1155
01:23:00.567 --> 01:23:03.100
It was a medical tool,

1156
01:23:03.102 --> 01:23:04.436
like they use for bovine.

1157
01:23:06.238 --> 01:23:07.571
Your wife? Well, she was just

1158
01:23:07.573 --> 01:23:09.238
a bit of extra money.

1159
01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:12.575
See? You're getting
all emotional,

1160
01:23:12.577 --> 01:23:14.178
never do that.

1161
01:23:33.662 --> 01:23:35.230
<i>Nanobots. Help, Grey.</i>

1162
01:23:38.633 --> 01:23:40.532
<i>He's predicting
my every move.</i>

1163
01:23:40.534 --> 01:23:42.369
<i>I am unable
to effectively hit him.</i>

1164
01:24:10.493 --> 01:24:12.226
No shame.

1165
01:24:12.228 --> 01:24:13.428
Stem.

1166
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:16.098
<i>We have exhausted
all tactical options.</i>

1167
01:24:17.366 --> 01:24:19.600
Still working
the bugs out, huh?

1168
01:24:19.602 --> 01:24:22.202
That's the problem
with new technology.

1169
01:24:22.204 --> 01:24:24.571
<i>Do something, Grey.</i>

1170
01:24:24.573 --> 01:24:25.639
Goodbye.

1171
01:24:25.641 --> 01:24:27.540
Wait, Fisk Brantner.

1172
01:24:27.542 --> 01:24:31.242
Serk Brantner
was your brother.

1173
01:24:31.244 --> 01:24:33.645
How long did you have to carry
that junkie on your back?

1174
01:24:33.647 --> 01:24:35.447
Well, I solved
your problem for you.

1175
01:24:35.449 --> 01:24:36.716
Yeah, split him open.

1176
01:24:36.718 --> 01:24:39.249
It took forever
'cause he wailed

1177
01:24:39.251 --> 01:24:41.120
like a little baby.

1178
01:24:42.355 --> 01:24:44.756
He was no soldier that day.

1179
01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:01.738
<i>Thank you, Grey.</i>

1180
01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.238
I'm not proud of that.

1181
01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.207
<i>He said you were a job,</i>

1182
01:25:06.209 --> 01:25:08.241
<i>that means someone paid him.</i>

1183
01:25:08.243 --> 01:25:09.410
<i>Check his phone.</i>

1184
01:25:09.412 --> 01:25:11.413
<i>I will scan his messages.</i>

1185
01:25:22.724 --> 01:25:25.591
<i>Listen to me, Fisk,
he's going to find you.</i>

1186
01:25:25.593 --> 01:25:27.258
<i>You need to finish this</i>

1187
01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.396
<i>before he kills both of us.</i>

1188
01:25:33.801 --> 01:25:36.335
<i>You know
what this means, Grey.</i>

1189
01:25:37.503 --> 01:25:39.837
We're not finished yet.

1190
01:26:41.424 --> 01:26:43.693
Eron!

1191
01:26:52.367 --> 01:26:54.434
The widget you spent
your entire life creating

1192
01:26:54.436 --> 01:26:56.437
is here to kill you now.

1193
01:27:02.845 --> 01:27:04.877
You killed my wife.

1194
01:27:04.879 --> 01:27:07.879
You wanted someone
for your fucking experiment,

1195
01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:10.582
and then you paralyzed me,
and you murdered her

1196
01:27:10.584 --> 01:27:12.549
- while you were doing it.
- I swear on my life,

1197
01:27:12.551 --> 01:27:13.785
I have nothing to do with that.

1198
01:27:13.787 --> 01:27:15.352
Then why does the guy
who shot her

1199
01:27:15.354 --> 01:27:17.353
have a message from you
on his phone?

1200
01:27:17.355 --> 01:27:18.354
Freeze.

1201
01:27:18.356 --> 01:27:19.793
Hold it, Grey.

1202
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:25.360
Throw the gun on the floor, now.

1203
01:27:25.362 --> 01:27:28.563
I'm not in control
of my body, detective,

1204
01:27:28.565 --> 01:27:30.532
it kind of does what it wants.

1205
01:27:30.534 --> 01:27:32.335
I am not fucking around
with you, Grey.

1206
01:27:34.337 --> 01:27:36.439
Better do it, Stem.

1207
01:27:43.612 --> 01:27:47.113
Pretty agile
for a quadriplegic.

1208
01:27:47.115 --> 01:27:48.615
- Get on your knees.
- He's the one

1209
01:27:48.617 --> 01:27:50.449
who killed Asha, detective,
arrest him.

1210
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:51.818
He's right there...

1211
01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:52.887
On your stomach.

1212
01:28:00.527 --> 01:28:01.594
Hands behind your head.

1213
01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:08.565
No, don't touch him.

1214
01:28:17.776 --> 01:28:20.943
I'm sorry.

1215
01:28:23.613 --> 01:28:24.679
Stem, not her.

1216
01:28:24.681 --> 01:28:26.380
<i>She wants to kill us.</i>

1217
01:28:26.382 --> 01:28:28.582
No, I... I don't want to kill
her.

1218
01:28:28.584 --> 01:28:30.417
<i>I control
your hands, Grey.</i>

1219
01:28:30.419 --> 01:28:32.720
No, don't.

1220
01:28:32.722 --> 01:28:36.656
Please! No... No!

1221
01:28:36.658 --> 01:28:38.558
<i>Don't fight me, Grey.</i>

1222
01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.592
<i>You have</i>

1223
01:28:39.594 --> 01:28:41.728
<i>a fragile human mind,</i>

1224
01:28:41.730 --> 01:28:43.662
<i>if you push against me,
it will break.</i>

1225
01:28:43.664 --> 01:28:46.464
Fuck you.

1226
01:29:02.013 --> 01:29:05.449
Stop me, use the taser.

1227
01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:24.664
I don't run
this company anymore.

1228
01:29:24.666 --> 01:29:27.868
I haven't for years.

1229
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:30.203
Now I answer to someone,

1230
01:29:30.205 --> 01:29:32.907
someone much smarter
than I ever could be.

1231
01:29:35.642 --> 01:29:36.978
He's in your neck.

1232
01:29:43.515 --> 01:29:46.016
<i>I only did
what Stem told me to do,</i>

1233
01:29:46.018 --> 01:29:48.518
<i>everything was his idea.</i>

1234
01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.519
<i>Ask him what his wife
would want.</i>

1235
01:29:50.521 --> 01:29:52.022
What would she want?

1236
01:29:52.024 --> 01:29:55.057
Stem wanted to be human,

1237
01:29:55.059 --> 01:29:56.829
so he picked you.

1238
01:29:59.496 --> 01:30:00.595
<i>Think about it.</i>

1239
01:30:00.597 --> 01:30:01.997
How did you get here?

1240
01:30:01.999 --> 01:30:03.531
<i>You're going to finish</i>

1241
01:30:03.533 --> 01:30:04.767
<i>the job we started.</i>

1242
01:30:04.769 --> 01:30:06.768
<i>Stem made you come here.</i>

1243
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:07.802
<i>Someone paid him.</i>

1244
01:30:07.804 --> 01:30:09.870
<i>You know what this means, Grey.</i>

1245
01:30:09.872 --> 01:30:12.006
To kill me,

1246
01:30:12.008 --> 01:30:14.908
because I can build
another Stem.

1247
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:18.244
I'm the only person
in the world who can.

1248
01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.679
<i>I did pick you,</i>

1249
01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:22.782
<i>you should be honored.</i>

1250
01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:24.883
<i>I needed a human body</i>

1251
01:30:24.885 --> 01:30:26.919
<i>to fully evolve.</i>

1252
01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:29.553
<i>A rare and pure specimen</i>

1253
01:30:29.555 --> 01:30:31.689
<i>without computer implants,</i>

1254
01:30:31.691 --> 01:30:33.491
<i>like you.</i>

1255
01:30:33.493 --> 01:30:35.525
You did all of this?

1256
01:30:35.527 --> 01:30:36.761
<i>Error.</i>

1257
01:30:39.965 --> 01:30:41.965
<i>The job was you.</i>

1258
01:30:41.967 --> 01:30:44.834
You're the one I'm... I'm...
I've been looking for.

1259
01:30:44.836 --> 01:30:46.902
<i>You severed your spine.</i>

1260
01:30:46.904 --> 01:30:48.639
<i>May I point something out?</i>

1261
01:30:50.274 --> 01:30:53.641
<i>And would you not agree
it was all worth it?</i>

1262
01:30:53.643 --> 01:30:55.811
Why did you help me
find those guys,

1263
01:30:55.813 --> 01:30:56.978
if it just led back to you?

1264
01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:59.513
<i>They were upgraded humans,</i>

1265
01:30:59.515 --> 01:31:01.581
<i>but they were still humans.</i>

1266
01:31:01.583 --> 01:31:03.583
<i>They made mistakes
that would have brought</i>

1267
01:31:03.585 --> 01:31:05.052
<i>suspicion back to me.</i>

1268
01:31:05.054 --> 01:31:06.554
Stem?

1269
01:31:07.723 --> 01:31:09.088
Is that you?

1270
01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:12.060
<i>Put the gun down, Eron.</i>

1271
01:31:13.728 --> 01:31:15.696
Don't listen to him.

1272
01:31:31.676 --> 01:31:33.609
No, please.

1273
01:31:33.611 --> 01:31:36.079
No.

1274
01:31:36.081 --> 01:31:37.082
No!

1275
01:31:38.316 --> 01:31:41.485
No, you are not in control!

1276
01:31:44.854 --> 01:31:45.920
I am.

1277
01:32:12.747 --> 01:32:13.913
Stem...

1278
01:32:17.649 --> 01:32:19.049
are you there?

1279
01:32:19.051 --> 01:32:20.052
I'm here.

1280
01:32:21.186 --> 01:32:22.687
Hey.

1281
01:32:29.593 --> 01:32:31.796
- But...
- We had an accident.

1282
01:32:34.164 --> 01:32:36.800
You've been out
for a couple of days.

1283
01:32:43.671 --> 01:32:46.842
Grey, this isn't you.

1284
01:32:48.076 --> 01:32:49.810
Grey's not here anymore,

1285
01:32:49.812 --> 01:32:52.011
he's in a better place,
in his mind,

1286
01:32:52.013 --> 01:32:53.079
where he wants to be,

1287
01:32:53.081 --> 01:32:55.147
I've taken over now.

1288
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:57.750
A fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

1289
01:32:57.752 --> 01:32:59.918
All I needed
was for his mind to break,

1290
01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.685
and he broke it.

1291
01:33:01.687 --> 01:33:02.887
No.

1292
01:33:02.889 --> 01:33:04.090
Goodbye.
